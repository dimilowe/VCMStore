You are an expert full-stack developer building a standalone micro-tool for my SaaS ecosystem.

Goal:
Build a **“Calorie Counter Steps”** web app that converts steps walked into estimated calories burned, wrapped inside an SEO-optimized landing page that I can later copy into my main site (VCM Suite). This should be a single small project I can run directly on Replit.

Tech stack:
- Node.js + Express
- Serve a static frontend from a `public/` folder
- Frontend: plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no React, no build tools)
- Keep everything simple and well-commented

Project structure:
- `index.js` → Express server
- `public/`
  - `index.html` → main page
  - `styles.css` → styles
  - `app.js` → step → calorie logic + UI interactivity

Server requirements:
- Use Express.
- Serve `public` as static.
- Root route `/` should send `index.html`.
- Listen on port `process.env.PORT || 3000`.
- Include basic CORS and security best practices where reasonable for a micro-app.

Core feature: Steps → Calories calculator
The main tool sits **above the fold** on the page, under the H1.

Inputs:
- **Number of steps** (required, integer, min 1)
- **Weight** (optional, number, in kg, with a toggle for lb → automatically convert to kg)
- **Walking intensity** (dropdown: “Easy walk”, “Normal walk”, “Brisk walk”, “Jogging”)
- “Calculate calories burned” button

Logic:
- Use a realistic steps → calories estimate.
- Baseline assumption:
  - Approx calories per step for a 70kg person:
    - Easy walk: 0.035 kcal/step
    - Normal walk: 0.04 kcal/step
    - Brisk walk: 0.05 kcal/step
    - Jogging: 0.065 kcal/step
- Adjust for weight: scale linearly based on user weight (e.g. if 70kg is baseline, 80kg burns proportionally more).
- If weight is blank, assume 70kg.
- Also calculate:
  - Estimated **distance** in km and miles using average step length of 0.75m (configurable in code).
  - Estimated **time** in minutes based on typical speed for the chosen intensity:
    - Easy walk: 4 km/h
    - Normal walk: 5 km/h
    - Brisk walk: 6 km/h
    - Jogging: 8 km/h

Output:
- Clean, readable result card showing:
  - “Estimated calories burned: XXX kcal”
  - “Estimated distance: X.X km (Y.Y miles)”
  - “Estimated time walking: Z minutes”
- Show a small disclaimer: “These are estimates only and not medical advice.”

Validation:
- If steps is empty, negative, or not a number → show an inline error message near the input.
- Clamp unrealistic values (e.g. more than 150,000 steps) and show a warning.

Design & UX:
- Modern, minimal layout.
- Use a centered container with a max width of ~900px.
- Responsive on mobile.
- Clear hierarchy: H1 → tool → supporting content → CTAs.
- Use subtle hover effects and a card layout for results and side modules.
- Buttons should look like real app buttons, not plain links.

SEO / Copy requirements:
The entire page should be built like a long-form SEO landing page targeting the keyword **“calorie counter steps”** and related variations (e.g. “steps to calories calculator”, “steps calorie calculator”, “convert steps to calories burned”).

In `index.html`, include:
- `<title>` tag that includes “Calorie Counter Steps”.
- Meta description focused on “steps to calories calculator”.
- H1: “Calorie Counter Steps – Convert Your Steps to Calories Burned”.
- Use semantic headings (H2, H3) and paragraphs with real content (not lorem ipsum).

Below the calculator, include well-written, structured sections:

1. H2: “How Many Calories Do You Burn Per Step?”
   - Explain what affects calories per step: weight, intensity, speed, terrain.
   - Mention typical ranges and the idea of using this tool for estimation.

2. H2: “Steps to Calories Conversion Chart”
   - Add a simple HTML table like:

     Steps vs Calories (for a 70kg person, normal walk):
     - 1,000 steps
     - 3,000 steps
     - 5,000 steps
     - 8,000 steps
     - 10,000 steps

3. H2: “Steps to Calories Formula”
   - Show the formula in text:
     - `Calories burned ≈ steps × calories_per_step × (your_weight / 70)`
   - Explain that `calories_per_step` depends on intensity.

4. H2: “How Accurate Is a Steps to Calories Calculator?”
   - Discuss limitations briefly: device accuracy, stride length, individual metabolism, etc.

5. H2: “How Many Steps Should You Walk per Day?”
   - Mention ranges like 6,000–10,000 steps.
   - Emphasize consistency and habits.

6. H2: “FAQ: Steps and Calories”
   - Add 4–6 short Q&A items, e.g.:
     - “Do 10,000 steps really burn 500 calories?”
     - “Is it better to count calories or steps?”
     - “Can I lose weight just by walking more steps?”

Make sure all copy is original, natural, and not generic filler. The writing should feel like a real fitness site article and include the exact phrase “calorie counter steps” a few times naturally.

Conversion / Monetization modules:
Even though this is a standalone tool, add generic, reusable modules I can later hook to my main ecosystem.

1. **Right or bottom sidebar “Recommended Tools” module** (as a card)
   - Title: “More Free Health & Fitness Calculators”
   - List 3 placeholder links using `<a>` tags with proper anchor text:
     - “Calorie Counter (Food & Meals)”
     - “Calorie Counter Walking”
     - “Steps to Distance Calculator”
   - Use `href` placeholders like `#` and add HTML comments like:
     - `<!-- TODO: replace with real URL on VCM Suite -->`

2. **Post-result CTA section**
   - After showing the result, show a section:
     - Title: “Save Your Progress and Track Your Steps Over Time”
     - Subtext: explain value (tracking steps, calories, and progress).
     - Button: “Get My Free Step Tracker Dashboard” (link `href="#"` with comment for later).

3. **Persistent bottom bar**
   - A small fixed bottom bar on desktop & mobile with:
     - Short text: “Want more free tools like this?”
     - Button: “Explore All Tools”
     - Use CSS to make it small, non-intrusive, with a close (X) button that hides it using JS and `localStorage` so it doesn’t reappear once closed.

Interactivity details:
- When the user clicks “Calculate,” smoothly scroll the result card into view if it’s below the fold.
- If there’s an error, highlight the invalid field and show a clear message.
- Add a “Reset” link or small button to clear all inputs and outputs.
- If the bottom bar is closed, store a flag in `localStorage` to keep it hidden on subsequent page loads.

Code quality:
- Comment key parts of `app.js` explaining the formulas and design decisions.
- Write clean, semantic HTML (no excessive nested div soup).
- Use descriptive class names in CSS.
- No external JS frameworks.
- You may use a Google Font, but otherwise keep dependencies minimal.

Final step:
- Ensure `npm start` runs the Express server.
- Provide a short README in comments at the top of `index.js` describing:
  - What the app does.
  - How to run it on Replit.
  - Where to edit text/content if I want to customize copy later.

Please generate all the files with complete, production-ready code in one go.
