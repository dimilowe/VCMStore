You are Replit AI. Build a production-ready MVP for “VCM Answers” — a Quora-style Q&A engine that lives on my store and generates indexable question pages for SEO.

STACK:
- Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- SQLite database
- EJS templates (server-rendered for SEO)
- TailwindCSS via CDN (no build step)
- No React. Everything server-rendered.

GOAL:
Users submit questions. Each question becomes its own SEO-optimized page. I answer each question once, and the page becomes evergreen content.

ROUTES:

1) GET /answers
- Main landing page.
- Shows:
  - Search bar
  - List of newest questions
  - List of trending questions (highest views/upvotes)
- Each question shows:
  - Title (link)
  - Short preview
  - Upvote count
  - Created timestamp

2) GET /answers/new
- Question submission form:
  - “Question Title” (required)
  - “More Details / Context” (optional)
  - “Your Name” (optional → default: Anonymous)
- POST /answers creates a question and redirects to its /answers/:slug page.

3) GET /answers/:slug
- Full question page with:
  - H1 question title
  - Context/body from user
  - “Answer” section (editable by admin later)
  - Upvote button (one per session)
  - View count increment
  - Related questions (same tags or similar titles)
- SEO elements:
  - <title>{question} – VCM Answers</title>
  - meta description (auto-generated from context)
  - canonical tag
  - structured data: QAPage schema

4) POST /answers/:id/answer
- Admin-only for now (keep route but comment out auth)
- Stores my answer (HTML or Markdown allowed)
- Updates updated_at

5) POST /answers/:id/vote
- Increment upvote count
- Use a session cookie ("vcm_answers_session") to ensure 1 upvote per question per user

DATABASE SCHEMA:

TABLE questions
- id INTEGER PK
- slug TEXT unique
- title TEXT
- context TEXT
- answer TEXT (nullable initially)
- upvote_count INTEGER default 0
- view_count INTEGER default 0
- created_at DATETIME
- updated_at DATETIME

TABLE question_votes
- id INTEGER PK
- question_id INTEGER
- session_id TEXT
- created_at DATETIME
- Unique (question_id, session_id)

TEMPLATES:
- /views/layout.ejs
- /views/answers/index.ejs
- /views/answers/new.ejs
- /views/answers/show.ejs

SEO REQUIREMENTS:
- Every question page must have unique:
  - <title>
  - meta description
  - canonical URL
  - H1 for question
  - QAPage schema (JSON-LD)
- Internal linking: show “Related Questions” list at bottom.

STYLING:
- Clean, minimalist, VCM-branded:
  - white background
  - simple cards
  - spacing + readable typography

OTHER NOTES:
- Any upvote/comment/view should trigger updated_at (freshness signal)
- Add sitemap route: GET /sitemap-answers.xml listing all question pages
- Add lightweight search: simple LIKE match on title

Goal: Deliver a working MVP that I can mount under /answers on my store domain, turning every question into an SEO win.
