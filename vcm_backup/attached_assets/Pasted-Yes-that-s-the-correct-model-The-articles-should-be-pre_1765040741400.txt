Yes, that’s the correct model. The articles should be pre-generated at the cluster level, sitting there as drafts, and your job should be “skim + toggle live,” not “write from scratch every time.”
Let me spell out what that actually means in system terms so you can build toward it.
1. What “pre-generated” should look like in your OS
When a cluster is created (like this calorie one), the system should:
Know the article plan
Titles
Slugs
Target keyword
Which tools to link to
Which sibling articles to link to
Which pillar page to link back to
Auto-generate the full article content once
H1/H2/H3 structure
Body copy (800–1500+ words)
Internal links already baked in
Suggested meta description
Suggested featured image description
Store it as a draft in your DB, NOT live:
status: "draft"
isIndexed: false
generatedAt timestamp
needsReview: true (optional flag)
Expose it in the admin like this:
Title + slug
Badge: Generated / Draft
Button: Preview
Toggles: Published and Indexed
So when you open this cluster, those 4 calorie articles are already written, already interlinked, already mapped. You just:
Click article → skim
Fix anything dumb
Flip Published ON
When happy, flip Indexed ON
Done.
2. Why this is better than “generate on click”
Pre-generated at cluster creation:
You can bulk-QA a whole cluster in one sitting
Your cluster health score can reflect “content ready but not indexed yet”
No waiting for generation when you’re in execution mode
You can see the full interlinking lattice immediately
Regenerate every time:
Slower
Inconsistent wording if you keep re-rolling
Harder to maintain stable interlink patterns
You want one deterministic pass at generation, then human QA, then live.
3. Your actual workflow once this is wired
For the calorie cluster, ideal state is:
Cluster created → system auto-generates the 4 articles into blog drafts.
You open the cluster view:
See 4/4 Articles – Generated, 0/4 Published
Click each:
Skim for tone/accuracy
Make any edits you want
Toggle:
Published = true
When ready for Google: Indexed = true
That’s it. No copy/paste hell, no manual interlinking.
4. What you’re missing right now
Right now you already have:
The cluster blueprint
Slugs
“Planned” status
Tool relationships
You don’t yet have:
A background step that actually writes the article and saves it as a blog draft tied to that slug.
Once you add that generator step, your expectation (“they’re pre-generated, I just check and toggle live”) becomes true.
