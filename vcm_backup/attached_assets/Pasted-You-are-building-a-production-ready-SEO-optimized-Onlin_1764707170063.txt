You are building a production-ready, SEO-optimized **“Online PDF Editor”** tool for the brand **VCM Suite**.

Goal: A fast, single-page web app that lets users upload a PDF, rearrange/rotate/delete pages, and download the edited PDF. It should rank for the keyword **“pdf editor website”** and related variants like “online pdf editor free”.

STACK & STRUCTURE
- No backend, no database, no auth.
- Pure front-end app using:
  - HTML5
  - Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - `pdf-lib` via CDN for all PDF manipulation in the browser.
- All files in root:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css` (optional; for any custom tweaks beyond Tailwind)
  - `main.js`

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
- Must work fully in the browser. All PDF processing is done client-side with `pdf-lib`.
- No build step required. Just static HTML/CSS/JS.
- Mobile-responsive, clean, modern UI that visually feels like a SaaS tool, not a generic template.
- Fast and simple UX: upload → see thumbnails → edit → download.

BRANDING / VISUALS
- Brand name in navbar: **VCM Suite** on the left, simple text logo (no external fonts other than Tailwind defaults).
- Page title: **VCM Suite – Free Online PDF Editor Website**
- Accent color: a bold orange for CTAs (Tailwind `bg-orange-500` / `hover:bg-orange-600`).
- Light gray background (`bg-slate-50`), white cards, subtle shadows, rounded corners.

         - “Rotate Right” button
         - “Delete Page” button
         - “Duplicate Page” button

         - Allow **drag-and-drop reordering**:
           - User can drag a thumbnail to change the page order.
           - Use basic HTML5 drag and drop, no external libs.

5. **FAQ / SEO Content Section**
   - Below the editor, include an SEO-rich FAQ section explaining the tool.
   - Use an H2: “About this Free PDF Editor Website”
   - Short paragraph using the exact phrase “pdf editor website” naturally.
   - FAQ with 4–5 collapsible Q&As (accordion style is nice but simple show/hide is fine):
     - “Is this PDF editor website really free to use?”
     - “Does my PDF leave my device when I edit it?”
     - “Can I rearrange and rotate PDF pages?”
     - “Is there a limit to how large my PDF can be?”

     - “free pdf editor website” etc.

6. **Footer**
   - Small footer with:
     - “© [current year] VCM Suite. All rights reserved.”
     - A subtle line: “Built as part of the VCM Suite free tools library.”
   - Simple and minimal.

INTERACTIVITY / LOGIC (main.js)
Use vanilla JS only.

1. **Initial State**
   - Hide the editor toolbar and thumbnails until a valid PDF is loaded.
   - Disable the “Download Edited PDF” button until at least one PDF is loaded.

2. **PDF Loading**
   - On file input change:
     - Validate the file:
       - Must be type `application/pdf`.
       - Max size 25MB (show a clear error if exceeded).
     - Read as `ArrayBuffer` using `FileReader`.
     - Use `pdf-lib` (load from CDN, e.g. `https://unpkg.com/pdf-lib/dist/pdf-lib.min.js`) to:
       - Load the PDF into a `PDFDocument`.
       - Get number of pages.
     - For each page:
       - Render a thumbnail using `<canvas>` OR simply approximate using a styled placeholder card with page number (if canvas rendering is too heavy, you can just show page numbers; but still keep data accurate).
       - Store current page order and rotation states in an array of objects:
         - `{ index: originalIndex, rotation: 0 | 90 | 180 | 270 }`

3. **Selecting Pages**
   - Clicking a thumbnail:
     - Marks it as selected (add a CSS class).
     - Only one page is selected at a time for rotation/deletion.
     - Show the current index and rotation somewhere in a small text label.

4. **Reordering Pages**
   - Implement drag-and-drop on thumbnail cards:
     - Use HTML5 drag events: `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`.
     - On drop, update the order array and re-render the thumbnail list.
     - Ensure page numbers update accordingly.

5. **Page Operations**
   - Rotate Left / Right:
     - If no page is selected, show a small inline warning (e.g., “Select a page first.”).
     - Otherwise, adjust the `rotation` value in the page object (+/- 90 degrees, wrap at 0–270).
     - Visually indicate rotation in the thumbnail (small rotated icon or text).
   - Delete Page:
     - Confirm (e.g., `confirm('Delete this page?')`).
     - Remove selected entry from the pages array and re-render.
     - If all pages are deleted, show a message and clear the current PDF state.
   - Duplicate Page:
     - Insert a copy of the selected page object right after it in the order array.
     - Page rotations should be copied as well.
   - Reset Changes:
     - Restore original order and zero rotation for all pages based on initial data.

6. **Download Edited PDF**
   - When user clicks “Download Edited PDF”:
     - Create a **new** `PDFDocument` via `PDFLib.PDFDocument.create()`.
     - For each page object in the current order array:
       - Copy the corresponding original page from the initially loaded PDF with `copyPages`.
       - Apply rotation to that page (using `setRotation` with appropriate `PDFLib.degrees()`).
       - Add the page to the new PDF with `addPage`.
     - Serialize the new PDF with `save()`.
     - Create a Blob and use `URL.createObjectURL` to trigger download:
       - Filename: original name with suffix: `-edited.pdf`
     - Handle errors gracefully with a toast or inline error message if serialization fails.

7. **Clear & Start Over**
   - Reset all state:
     - Clear file input.
     - Clear thumbnails.
     - Hide toolbar and download button.
     - Clear any error messages.
   - Let user upload a new PDF.

8. **Error Handling and UX Details**
   - Add a small “status” area near the upload button:
     - Messages like “Loading PDF…”, “PDF loaded successfully”, or error messages.
   - Disable buttons while PDF is loading.
   - If `pdf-lib` fails to load, show a clear error banner telling the user to refresh.
   - Guard against users trying to click actions before a PDF is loaded.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Use semantic HTML: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`.
- All buttons must have descriptive `aria-label`s.
- Make sure keyboard users can:
  - Tab through thumbnails.
  - Activate Rotate/Delete/Download with Enter/Space.
- Ensure text has good contrast (use Tailwind grays, not super light text).

SEO / PERFORMANCE
- Put the main keyword “pdf editor website” in:
  - `<title>`
  - H1 text
  - First paragraph
  - At least one FAQ answer
- Use only necessary JS. No heavy animations.
- Avoid unnecessary external fonts or big images.
- Add a small inline `<style>` or use `style.css` only for tweaks, keeping the bulk in Tailwind classes.

FINAL CHECKLIST
- App runs perfectly by opening `index.html` in a browser (or via Replit web preview).
- User can:
  - Upload a PDF
  - See pages in order
  - Select a page
  - Drag to reorder pages
  - Rotate, delete, duplicate pages
  - Reset all changes
  - Download a correctly edited PDF
- SEO text is present and readable, not spammy.
- Brand name “VCM Suite” appears in navbar, title, and footer.

Build all three files now: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` with the above requirements fully implemented.
