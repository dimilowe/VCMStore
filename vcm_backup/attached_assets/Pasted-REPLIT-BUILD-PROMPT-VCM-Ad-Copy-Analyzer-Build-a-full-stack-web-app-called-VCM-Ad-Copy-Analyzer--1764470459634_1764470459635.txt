REPLIT BUILD PROMPT – VCM Ad Copy Analyzer
Build a full-stack web app called “VCM Ad Copy Analyzer”.
The purpose of this tool is to let users paste in ad copy (their own + competitor’s), select context (platform, goal, audience), and get an AI-powered breakdown + improved variations using the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
🔧 Tech Stack
Use this stack:
Backend: Node.js + Express
Frontend: React + Vite
Styling: Tailwind CSS
API calls: Fetch from frontend to backend, backend to OpenAI
Config: .env for OPENAI_API_KEY (never hardcode it)
Structure it as a single Replit project:
/server for Express backend
/client for React frontend
Root-level package.json with scripts:
"dev" to run both client and server concurrently (e.g. with concurrently)
"server" for backend
"client" for frontend
🔐 Environment Variables
Use .env on the backend with:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Do not expose this key to the frontend.
🌐 Backend Requirements (Express)
Create an Express server in /server with:
CORS enabled for the React client
JSON body parsing
A single main endpoint:
POST /api/analyze-ad
Request body JSON:
{
  "competitorAd": "string",
  "myAd": "string (optional)",
  "platform": "Meta | TikTok | YouTube | Google | LinkedIn | Other",
  "goal": "Leads | Purchases | Awareness | Clicks | App Installs | Other",
  "audience": "short description of the target audience",
  "brandTone": "Neutral | Bold | Playful | Luxury | Educational | Other"
}
Validation rules:
competitorAd is required, non-empty string.
Other fields can be optional but should default to reasonable values if missing.
If invalid, return 400 with a JSON error { error: "message" }.
What the backend should do:
Build a system prompt for OpenAI telling it to act as a senior direct-response ad copy strategist.
Pass user inputs into the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
Return a structured JSON response to the frontend with clearly separated fields.
Use the OpenAI chat completion endpoint with a reasonably cheap model (e.g. gpt-4.1-mini or similar). The model name can be a constant so it’s easy to change.
OpenAI prompt behavior:
Tell the model to analyze the ad in structured form and respond in strict JSON only, with this structure:
{
  "summary": "Short 2-3 sentence summary of what the competitor ad is trying to do.",
  "overallScore": 0-100,
  "scores": {
    "hook": 0-10,
    "clarity": 0-10,
    "benefits": 0-10,
    "proof": 0-10,
    "specificity": 0-10,
    "cta": 0-10,
    "platformFit": 0-10
  },
  "diagnosis": [
    "Short bullet-style insight 1",
    "Short bullet-style insight 2",
    "Short bullet-style insight 3"
  ],
  "whatWorks": [
    "What is strong about this ad"
  ],
  "whatHurts": [
    "What is weak or confusing about this ad"
  ],
  "improvements": [
    "Actionable suggestion 1",
    "Actionable suggestion 2",
    "Actionable suggestion 3"
  ],
  "myAdComparison": {
    "isMyAdProvided": true,
    "summary": "If myAd is provided, compare my ad vs competitor. If not, explain that only competitor was analyzed.",
    "strongerAreas": [
      "Where my ad is stronger"
    ],
    "weakerAreas": [
      "Where my ad is weaker"
    ],
    "priorityFixesForMyAd": [
      "Top 3 changes I'd make to my ad first"
    ]
  },
  "rewrites": {
    "safeUpgrade": "Improved version of the competitor ad that keeps the same overall structure but stronger.",
    "boldVersion": "More aggressive / scroll-stopping version tuned to the platform and goal.",
    "shortFormHookLines": [
      "5-10 ultra short hooks for short-form video primary text or opening line."
    ],
    "headlines": [
      "3-5 strong headlines for the platform."
    ],
    "ctaIdeas": [
      "3-5 CTA lines matched to the goal."
    ]
  },
  "platformNotes": "1-2 paragraphs on how well this fits the chosen platform and what to change for that platform.",
  "audienceNotes": "1-2 paragraphs on how well this speaks to the target audience and what to adjust."
}
The model must respond with valid JSON only.
Backend should try/catch JSON parsing; if parsing fails, return a 500 with a generic error.
Backend error handling:
If OpenAI fails or times out, respond with:
{ "error": "Failed to analyze ad. Please try again later." }
🖥 Frontend Requirements (React + Tailwind)
Create a clean, modern single-page UI in /client:
Layout
Centered layout with max width ~900px.
Simple top header:
“VCM Ad Copy Analyzer”
Subtext: “Paste in any ad and get a breakdown, score, and better versions.”
Use Tailwind for spacing, typography, and containers.
Input Panel (left/top)
Form fields:
Competitor Ad Copy (required)
Multi-line <textarea>
Label: “Competitor Ad Copy”
Placeholder: “Paste the full ad copy here (primary text, headline, CTA, etc.).”
My Ad Copy (optional)
Multi-line <textarea>
Label: “Your Ad Copy (optional)”
Placeholder: “Paste your version to compare and improve.”
Platform (select)
Options: Meta, TikTok, YouTube, Google, LinkedIn, Other
Goal (select)
Options: Leads, Purchases, Awareness, Clicks, App Installs, Other
Audience (text)
Single-line input
Placeholder: “e.g. early-stage creators trying to grow with no ad budget”
Brand Tone (select)
Options: Neutral, Bold, Playful, Luxury, Educational, Other
Submit Button
“Analyze Ad”
Disabled while loading, show spinner or “Analyzing…” state.
On submit:
Validate that Competitor Ad Copy is not empty.
Show a basic toast or inline error if missing.
Send POST request to /api/analyze-ad with the JSON body described above.
Output Panel (below or right)
Once the response comes back, render:
Overall Score
Large number (0–100) with color coding (e.g. red <60, yellow 60–80, green 80+).
Score Breakdown (grid or list)
Hook, Clarity, Benefits, Proof, Specificity, CTA, Platform Fit
Each with 0–10 score and small horizontal bar.
Summary & Diagnosis
Short summary text from summary.
List out diagnosis bullets.
What Works / What Hurts
Two columns or two sections with lists from whatWorks and whatHurts.
Improvements
“Top Fixes” bullet list from improvements.
My Ad Comparison (if isMyAdProvided is true)
Short paragraph from myAdComparison.summary.
Bullets for strongerAreas, weakerAreas, and priorityFixesForMyAd.
Rewrites Section
Safe Upgrade – show rewrites.safeUpgrade in a copyable card (with a “Copy” button).
Bold Version – show rewrites.boldVersion.
Short-Form Hook Lines – show each in a bullet list.
Headlines – bullet list.
CTAs – bullet list.
Platform & Audience Notes
Two text blocks: platformNotes and audienceNotes.
UX Details
Show a loading state while waiting for the backend.
Show a clear error message if the backend returns { error: "..." }.
Add small text at the bottom:
“Powered by VCM Suite • Built for creators and marketers.”
🧪 Testing / Quality
Add a simple sample ad in a “Try Sample” button that fills the fields with example data so the user can demo quickly.
Make sure the app handles:
Empty competitor ad → front-end validation stops request.
OpenAI or server failure → friendly error displayed in the UI.
Invalid JSON from OpenAI → backend catches and returns error.
📦 Scripts
Root package.json should have something like:
"server": "cd server && node index.js" (or nodemon if you add it)
"client": "cd client && npm run dev"
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
Make sure everything runs in Replit with npm install at root and a single npm run dev entry point.
✅ Final Deliverable
A working Replit app where:
I can paste in competitor ad copy (and optionally my own).
Select platform, goal, audience, brand tone.
Click “Analyze Ad”.
See a detailed, structured breakdown and multiple rewritten options.
This tool should feel like a VCM-branded, no-BS ad copy strategist in a browser.
