Server requirements:
- Serve `public` as static.
- `/` → `index.html`

CORE FEATURE: BMI + CALORIE CALCULATOR
-----------------------------------

The calculator must:
- Compute BMI and show category.
- Estimate daily maintenance calories (TDEE) based on BMI inputs.
- Show weight targets and related calorie guidelines.

Inputs:
- Sex (radio: Male / Female).
- Age (years).
- Height:
  - cm input, with an optional feet/inches toggle (convert to cm internally).
- Weight:
  - kg input, with an optional lb toggle (convert to kg internally).
- Activity level dropdown:
  - Sedentary
  - Lightly active
  - Moderately active
  - Very active
  - Super active

Validation:
- Age between 14 and 80.
- Height between 130 and 220 cm.
- Weight between 35 and 200 kg.
- All fields required.

Logic (in `app.js`):

1) BMI:
   - `BMI = weight_kg / (height_m^2)`
   - Categorize:
     - <18.5 → Underweight
     - 18.5–24.9 → Normal weight
     - 25–29.9 → Overweight
     - 30+ → Obese

2) BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor):
   - Men: `BMR = 10*weight_kg + 6.25*height_cm – 5*age + 5`
   - Women: `BMR = 10*weight_kg + 6.25*height_cm – 5*age – 161`

3) Activity multiplier:
   - Sedentary: 1.2
   - Lightly active: 1.375
   - Moderately active: 1.55
   - Very active: 1.725
   - Super active: 1.9

4) Maintenance calories (TDEE):
   - `TDEE = BMR × activity multiplier`

5) Suggested ranges:
   - Mild weight loss: TDEE − 10–15%
   - Aggressive weight loss: TDEE − 20%
   - Mild weight gain: TDEE + 10–15%

Outputs (result card):
- “Your BMI: XX.X (Category: Normal / Overweight / etc.)”
- “Estimated daily maintenance calories: YYYY kcal”
- “Suggested calorie range for weight loss: AAAA–BBBB kcal”
- “Suggested calorie range for weight gain: CCCC–DDDD kcal”
- Short interpretation: e.g., “Your BMI is in the ‘Overweight’ range. If your goal is fat loss, staying within the suggested calorie deficit may help over time.”
- Disclaimer: “BMI and calorie estimates are approximate and do not replace professional medical advice.”

UX:
- On “Calculate”:
  - If valid, scroll to results card smoothly.
  - If invalid, highlight first invalid field and show error.
- Add a “Reset” link to clear inputs and outputs.

DESIGN / LAYOUT
