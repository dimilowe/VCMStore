You are an expert full-stack dev building a small, SEO-optimized micro-site around the keyword “calorie counter best”.

Goal:
Build a **Best Calorie Counter** comparison mini-site with:
- A simple embedded calorie counter tool on the homepage.
- A detailed comparison section of “best calorie counters”.
- 2 supporting articles to build topical depth.
- Implemented as a Node/Express app that serves static HTML/CSS/JS (no React, no bundlers) so it runs cleanly on Replit.

Tech stack:
- Node.js + Express
- Static frontend in `public/` (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS only)

Project structure:
- `index.js` → Express server
- `public/`
  - `index.html` → main “best calorie counter” page
  - `article-how-to-choose-best-calorie-counter.html` → supporting article #1
  - `article-calorie-counter-mistakes.html` → supporting article #2
  - `styles.css`
  - `app.js`

Server requirements:
- Use Express.
- Serve `public` as static.
- `/` → `index.html`
- `/how-to-choose-best-calorie-counter` → `article-how-to-choose-best-calorie-counter.html`
- `/calorie-counter-mistakes` → `article-calorie-counter-mistakes.html`
- Listen on `process.env.PORT || 3000`.
- At the top of `index.js`, add a short comment explaining:
  - What this mini-site does.
  - How to run it on Replit (`npm install` then `npm start`).

CORE FEATURE: SIMPLE CALORIE COUNTER (FOOD TOTAL)
------------------------------------------------

The homepage must include a simple, fast “best-in-class” calorie counter.

Inputs:
- A small “Daily Intake” card with:
  - Numeric field: “Total calories eaten today” (required)
  - Optional numeric field: “Target calories per day”
- Button: “Calculate”

Logic (in `app.js`):
- If target is blank, default to 2,000 kcal.
- Show:
  - Total calories consumed.
  - Difference vs target (surplus or deficit).
  - A status line: “Below target”, “On target”, or “Above target”.

Validation:
- Total calories required, > 0 and < 10,000.
- Target > 500 and < 10,000.
- Show inline error messages near invalid inputs.

Output (result card):
- “Today’s intake: XXXX kcal”
- “Your target: YYYY kcal”
- “Difference: +/−ZZZ kcal (surplus/deficit)”
- Short interpretation line like:
  - “You’re slightly under your goal today, which may support weight loss if consistent.”

UX:
- On Calculate, scroll smoothly to the results card if it’s below the fold.
- Add a tiny “Reset” link to clear fields and result.

-----------------------------------
DESIGN / LAYOUT AND VISUAL STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------

- Centered container, max width around 960px.
- Clean, modern layout with:
  - Header
  - Main content
  - “Best calorie counter” comparison table section
  - Footer
- Use a single Google Font (e.g. Inter or Roboto).
- Use card-style components (with box shadow, border-radius).
- Fully responsive for mobile.
