4. DATA MODEL EXTENSIONS — CRUCIAL
Replit’s version is correct but incomplete.
You need at minimum:
primaryKeyword
secondaryKeywords[]
searchIntent ("informational" | "action" | "transactional")
engineId
pillarSlug
clusterSlug
recommendedTools[]
recommendedArticles[]
This is how you create a semantic layer and not a chaotic dump of tools.
This also enables:
automated linking
automated breadcrumbs
automated CTA selection
automated schema injection
automated sitemap grouping
automated cluster reporting
This is how you transform SEO from “guessing” into manufacturing.
⭐️ NOW LET ME SHOW YOU THE REAL PHASE 2 PLAN
Not the theoretical version.
The VCM version.
🔥 THE PHASE 2 EXECUTION MAP
150 → 1,000 total pages
STEP 1 — Build 10 Engines
Each engine = 1 pillar topic.
Examples:
Image resizing engine
Estimator engine
Calculator engine
Predictor engine
Converter engine
Analyzer engine
AI generator engine
Checker engine
Randomizer engine
Name/combiner engine
STEP 2 — Create the Keyword Matrix for Each Engine
Image engine example:
instagram
tiktok
youtube
pinterest
twitter
linkedin
facebook
blog
Plus:
vertical
horizontal
1080x1920
4:5
1:1
16:9
1280x720
poster size
Multiply them → 200+ skins.
STEP 3 — Auto-generate tool pages from the matrix
Every tool gets:
unique title
unique h1
unique meta description
tailored intro
engine component
custom SEO copy block
CTA block
related tools block
related articles block
STEP 4 — Build the clusters
Engine page = cluster index.
Articles = cluster support.
Tools = cluster spokes.
STEP 5 — Deploy internal linking automation
Every tool links to:
3 tools from the same cluster
2 articles
1 revenue CTA
Every article links to:
pillar page
most relevant tool
3+ supporting articles
You use a small script to auto-generate these relations.
STEP 6 — Add schema at the engine, cluster, and page levels
This is where Google begins to treat you as a knowledge graph.
STEP 7 — Add monetization overlays
Every tool becomes a distribution channel for:
QR Social
Nudge
APE
ClipFits
Stemly Files
Bordz
You're not “SEOing.”
You're building the front door to an empire.
