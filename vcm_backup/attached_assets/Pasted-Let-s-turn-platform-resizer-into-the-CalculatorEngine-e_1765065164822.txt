Let’s turn platform-resizer into the CalculatorEngine equivalent for images: one engine, infinite resizer tools, all fully SEO + monetization ready.
1. What the Resizer Engine should be
Goal: any tool with engine = "platform-resizer" should automatically become:
a proper image resizer UI (upload → preview → download)
a platform-specific guide (dimensions, ratios, file size, safe zones)
an SEO page (FAQ, schema, internal links)
a monetization page (upsells into creator tools / OS)
Exactly like CalculatorEngine, but for image surfaces.
Think:
/tools/youtube-thumbnail-resizer
/tools/instagram-post-resizer
/tools/tiktok-story-resizer
/tools/linkedin-banner-resizer
All sharing ONE engine, just with different presets.
2. Define the preset shape for platform-resizer
You want a single preset registry keyed by slug or by {platform, surface}.
Something like:
// data/platformImagePresets.ts
export type PlatformResizerPreset = {
  id: string; // "youtube-thumbnail"
  platformId: string; // "youtube"
  surfaceId: string;  // "thumbnail" | "post" | "story" | "banner" etc.

  // Core dimensions
  width: number;
  height: number;
  aspectRatio: string; // "16:9", "9:16", etc.

  // Platform guidance
  displayName: string; // "YouTube Thumbnail"
  platformLabel: string; // "YouTube"
  surfaceLabel: string;  // "Thumbnail"
  recommendedSizeCopy: string;
  safeZoneNotes: string;
  maxFileSizeMB: number;
  acceptedFormats: string[];

  // SEO text
  seo: {
    h1: string;
    intro: string;
    keyword: string;
    metaDescription: string;
  };

  // FAQ & schema
  faqs: { question: string; answer: string }[];

  // Linking
  relatedToolSlugs: string[];   // other resizers
  relatedArticleSlugs: string[]; // “YouTube Thumbnail Guide”, etc.
};
You already have some presets; this just formalizes them and adds FAQ + SEO + related.
The resizer engine will:
take tool.slug
look up the matching preset
render everything from it.
3. ResizerEngine v2: structure it like CalculatorEngine
Inside PlatformResizerEngineClient (or whatever you call it), you want this layout:
Hero/Header
Title: from tool or preset.seo.h1
Badges:
Platform: YouTube / Instagram / TikTok
Surface: Thumbnail / Post / Story / Banner
Short intro: preset.seo.intro
Main UI: Resizer
File upload
Show original dimensions
Target size (with preset width/height)
“Resize & Download” button
Live preview of the resized image
Platform Guidance Block
“Recommended size: 1280 × 720 (16:9)”
“Max file size: 2MB”
“Safe zone: keep text in center 90%”
Maybe a small table of other key image sizes for that platform (thumbnails, banners, profile, etc.)
PostResultUpsell (creator-focused)
After upload/resizing, show:
“Want more views on this thumbnail? Try [YouTube CTR Calculator] / [AI Thumbnail Coach] / [Nudge].”
Same component you used for calculators but with an image/creator angle:
“Turn this resized image into real clicks and watch time.”
FAQ + JSON-LD
preset.faqs drives:
The on-page accordion
FAQ JSON-LD
Example questions:
“What is the best size for a YouTube thumbnail?”
“Will resizing an image reduce quality?”
“What resolution should I use for YouTube on mobile and TV?”
“Can I use the same thumbnail for Shorts and long-form?”
ExploreMoreTools (related resizers)
Show 4–6 related tools from relatedToolSlugs:
instagram-post-resizer
tiktok-video-cover-resizer
youtube-channel-banner-resizer, etc.
Related Articles
From relatedArticleSlugs:
“YouTube Thumbnail Best Practices”
“How to Design High-CTR Thumbnails”
“Instagram Image Sizes Guide 2025”
Schema
SoftwareApplication (image tool)
FAQ schema
4. How to wire it into your existing system
Here’s what Replit needs to do, concretely:
Preset registry
Create data/platformImagePresets.ts that exports a map:
PRESETS_BY_SLUG: Record<string, PlatformResizerPreset>
Fill in presets at least for:
youtube-thumbnail-resizer
instagram-post-resizer
tiktok-video-cover-resizer
whatever shells you already have.
Engine → preset resolution
In PlatformResizerEngineClient, do:
const preset = PRESETS_BY_SLUG[tool.slug];
if (!preset) return <MissingPresetFallback tool={tool} />;
Use preset to drive:
UI labels
FAQ content
schema
related tools/articles.
Upgrade the engine layout
Copy the same pattern as CalculatorEngine:
hero
main tool body
upsell
FAQ
related
schema
Can reuse the same FAQ component, ExploreMoreTools, PostResultUpsell components.
Connect to your clusters
Make sure your resizer tools:
have cluster = "social-media-image-sizes" or whatever you’re using
appear in that cluster’s tools list
linkRules for the resizer blueprint(s) should match what the engine now renders:
siblingsPerTool
pillarSlug
articlesPerTool
Test one end-to-end
Pick youtube-thumbnail-resizer:
Does it show correct dimensions?
Correct FAQ?
Correct schema?
Correct related tools?
Does it actually resize and download the image cleanly?
Fix preset → every other resizer using that engine benefits.
5. Tie this back into your blueprint system
You already have Image Resizer Niche and platform-resizer blueprints.
Once the engine is upgraded:
Any new shells created by those blueprints with engineId: "platform-resizer":
auto-render through this engine.
Instantly become SEO/monetization pages once you add presets.
So:
Phase 1: Upgrade platform-resizer engine + build presets for your existing main resizers.
Phase 2: Add more presets + run blueprint expansion → all shells become real tools.
Phase 3: Add 1–2 resizer-specific articles and a solid pillar.
