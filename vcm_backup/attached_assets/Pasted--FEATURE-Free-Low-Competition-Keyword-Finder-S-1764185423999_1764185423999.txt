FEATURE: Free Low-Competition Keyword Finder (SEO)
Route: /tools/keyword-finder
====================================================

GOAL
Create a simple, fast AI-powered tool that:
- Accepts a seed keyword or topic from the user
- Returns a list of **low-competition keyword ideas** for SEO
- For each keyword shows:
  - Keyword
  - Estimated difficulty (0–100)
  - Estimated search volume (rough band, not exact)
  - Intent (Informational / Transactional / Commercial / Navigational)
  - Recommended content angle / title idea
- Defaults to only showing **low competition** ideas (difficulty <= 30)
- Lets users:
  - Filter by max difficulty
  - Sort by difficulty or volume
  - Export results as CSV
  - Copy all results to clipboard

IMPORTANT:
- Do **NOT** integrate with external SEO APIs (no Semrush, Ahrefs, Ubersuggest, SerpAPI, etc.).
- Use only the OpenAI API (chat/completions) to *estimate* difficulty & volume based on patterns.
- The output does not have to be perfectly accurate; it must be plausible and useful.

ENV CONFIG
- Read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from process.env.
- Add a small note on the page: “Estimates only — based on AI, not live SEO APIs.”

====================================================
BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION
====================================================

Create a Next.js API route:

- File: `app/api/keyword-finder/route.ts`

Behavior:
- Accepts POST requests with JSON body:
  {
    seed: string;             // user’s seed keyword or topic
    maxResults?: number;      // default 50
    maxDifficulty?: number;   // default 30
    language?: string;        // default "English"
  }

- Validate:
  - seed must be non-empty string
  - Enforce sensible limits: maxResults <= 100

- Call OpenAI Chat Completions (use the appropriate SDK already in the project or install `openai` if needed).

System prompt for OpenAI (paraphrase this but keep structure):

"""
You are an SEO strategist. Given a seed keyword or topic, you generate ONLY **long-tail, low-competition keyword ideas** with real searcher intent, focusing on opportunities smaller websites can rank for.

Rules:
- Focus on very specific, long-tail phrases (3+ words).
- Avoid super general head terms like "marketing", "SEO", "shoes".
- Assume global English search unless otherwise specified.
- Estimate difficulty from 0–100 where:
  - 0–20 = very easy
  - 21–35 = easy
  - 36–55 = medium
  - 56+ = hard
- Return mostly keywords with difficulty <= {maxDifficulty}, only a few slightly above to show range.
- Estimate monthly search volume as a rough bucket: 10, 30, 70, 150, 300, 700, 1200, 2400, etc.
- Classify intent as: informational, transactional, commercial, or navigational.

Respond in **pure JSON** only, no commentary, with this exact shape:

{
  "seed": "<seed keyword>",
  "keywords": [
    {
      "keyword": "string",
      "difficulty": number,
      "searchVolume": number,
      "intent": "informational" | "transactional" | "commercial" | "navigational",
      "contentAngle": "string - suggested article or page angle",
      "notes": "short note on why this is a good low-competition opportunity"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Ensure `keywords.length` <= {maxResults}.
"""

- Insert the actual seed, maxResults, maxDifficulty, and language into the prompt string.
- Parse the JSON returned by OpenAI.
- On error (invalid JSON, API error), respond with 500 and a safe message.

Response from API route:
- 200 JSON:
  {
    seed: string;
    keywords: KeywordIdea[];
  }

Where `KeywordIdea` matches the shape above.

====================================================
FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION
====================================================

Create a new page:

- File: `app/tools/keyword-finder/page.tsx`

Page goals:
- Very similar styling/layout to the other tools (GIF compressor, image compressor, etc.).
- Use the existing global navbar and footer automatically via app/layout.tsx (do NOT re-import the Navbar manually).

Layout sections:

1) HERO SECTION
----------------
- H1: “Free Low-Competition Keyword Finder”
- Subtext: “Discover SEO keywords you can actually rank for. Enter a topic and get long-tail, low-difficulty ideas in seconds. Completely free.”
- Add a small line: “Estimates only — AI-based, not live SEO API data.”

2) INPUT FORM
--------------
Card-style container with:

- Text input:
  - Label: “Seed keyword or topic”
  - Placeholder: “e.g. ‘qr codes for business cards’, ‘dance content ideas’, ‘online course marketing’”

- Number input or slider:
  - Label: “Maximum difficulty”
  - Default: 30
  - Range: 10–60

- Number input:
  - Label: “Max results”
  - Default: 50
  - Min: 10, Max: 100

- (Optional) Select:
  - Label: “Language”
  - Options: English (default), Spanish, French, German, etc.
  - This can just be passed into the prompt; we don’t need deep localization.

- Primary button: “Find low-competition keywords”

UX:
- Disable button + show spinner while request in-flight.
- Basic validation: seed is required.

3) RESULTS TABLE
-----------------
After the API returns data:

- Show a summary line:
  - “Showing X low-competition keyword ideas for: ‘<seed>’.”
  - A badge showing: “Max difficulty: NN”

- Display results in a responsive table:

  Columns:
  - Keyword
  - Difficulty (with colored badge: green for <=20, yellow for 21–35, orange for >35)
  - Search Volume (approx)
  - Intent
  - Content Angle (short text)

- Allow client-side sorting by:
  - Difficulty (ascending/descending)
  - Search Volume (ascending/descending)

- At the top-right of the results section, add buttons:
  - “Copy all keywords” → copies comma-separated list (or lines) of just the keyword strings.
  - “Download CSV” → triggers a client-side CSV download with all columns.

4) ERROR & EMPTY STATES
------------------------
- If no results: show a gently worded message and suggest trying a broader seed.
- If API fails: show “Something went wrong. Please try again in a minute.”

====================================================
SEO + COPY ON THE PAGE
====================================================

Below the tool, add SEO text content (simple, not huge — I can edit later):

Sections:

1) H2: “What is a Low-Competition Keyword?”
   - 2–3 short paragraphs explaining:
     - A low-competition keyword = phrase where small sites can rank.
     - Usually long-tail, more specific, lower SEO difficulty.
     - Ideal for blogs, creators, and new projects.

2) H2: “How This Free Keyword Tool Works”
   - Explain:
     - Uses AI to analyze patterns and suggest long-tail ideas.
     - Estimates difficulty and volume as directional, not exact.
     - Designed for creators, indie hackers, and small businesses.

3) H2: “How to Use These Keywords With VCM OS”
   - 2–3 bullet points:
     - Turn winning keywords into blog posts, YouTube videos, or landing pages.
     - Use APE to monetize traffic with paywalled content.
     - Use QR Social to connect offline and short-form content to these SEO assets.
     - Use other free tools (GIF compressor, image compressor, logo generator) as part of your content creation workflow.

Make sure:
- The page uses `<title>` and `<meta>` tags via Next.js metadata export:

Suggested:
- Title: “Free Low-Competition Keyword Finder | VCM Store SEO Tools”
- Description: “Discover low-competition SEO keywords you can actually rank for. Free AI-powered keyword tool that finds long-tail opportunities with estimated difficulty and volume.”

====================================================
NAVBAR INTEGRATION
====================================================

In the existing Resources / Freebies dropdown (where GIF Compressor, Image Compressor, Word Counter, Logo Generator live):

- Add a new item:
  - Label: “Keyword Finder”
  - Subtext: “Find low-competition SEO ideas”
  - Link: `/tools/keyword-finder`

Make sure the styling matches the other items.

====================================================
CODE QUALITY NOTES
====================================================

- Use TypeScript types for the API response and for the `KeywordIdea`.
- Handle loading and error states explicitly in the frontend.
- Keep components small:
  - The form can be a `KeywordFinderForm` component.
  - The results table can be a separate `KeywordResultsTable` component.
- Use Tailwind for styling and keep it consistent with current tool pages.
- Do NOT log the raw OpenAI API key anywhere.
- Add basic input sanitization on the backend.

Once done, ensure:
- The new route builds correctly.
- The page is responsive (mobile → stacked layout).
- The tool works end-to-end: user enters a topic, clicks generate, sees realistic keyword ideas.
