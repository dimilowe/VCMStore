REPLIT PROMPT: Free Online PD (Pupillary Distance) Measurement Tool
You are building a single-page web app that lets users measure their pupillary distance (PD) online using a selfie and a reference object (e.g. a credit card). This tool is meant to rank for keywords like “online tool to measure pd”, “pupillary distance online”, and “measure pd with photo”, and funnel traffic into the VCM OS / APE ecosystem.
🔧 Tech Stack
Node.js + Express (simple server, static files only)
HTML + Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling
Vanilla JavaScript for all logic (no frameworks)
Optional: HTML <canvas> for overlay + drag handles
No database, no external APIs, no server-side image processing
(everything runs client-side for privacy + zero cost)
1. Project Structure
Create:
index.js – Express server
public/
index.html – main page UI
app.js – PD measurement logic
style.css – (optional) extra styles, most via Tailwind
index.js
Basic Express setup:
const express = require('express')
Serve public as static
Route / → index.html
Listen on process.env.PORT || 3000
2. Page Layout (index.html)
Use a clean, mobile-first design similar in feel to your GIF/Image tools.
Include in <head>:
<title>Online Tool to Measure PD – Free Pupillary Distance Calculator</title>
Meta description:
"Free online tool to measure your pupillary distance (PD) using a simple selfie and a card. No sign-up, no app, completely free."
Open Graph tags for title/description/URL/preview image.
Tailwind CSS CDN link.
Overall Layout
Inside <body>:
Background: light neutral (bg-slate-50)
Main container: max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-10
Sections (top to bottom):
2.1 Header / Hero
H1: Free Online Tool to Measure PD
Subheading:
“Upload a selfie and use a credit card as a size reference to measure your pupillary distance (PD) for online glasses orders. No app, no sign-up, 100% free.”
Centered text.
2.2 PD Tool Card
A white card: bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-md p-6 md:p-8 mt-6.
Inside the card:
A. Step Indicator
Small horizontal step labels like:
Upload Photo
Set Scale
Mark Pupils
Get PD
Use a simple flex row with highlighted current step.
B. Photo Upload Area
Label: “Step 1: Upload a front-facing selfie”
Instructions:
Face the camera straight.
Remove glasses.
Good lighting.
Hold a credit card or any standard-sized card horizontally under your nose (front side facing camera).
File input (<input type="file" accept="image/*">) styled as a big button (“Upload Photo”).
After upload, display the image centered above a canvas overlay area.
C. Canvas & Overlays
Use an <div> container that holds:
The uploaded image (<img id="uploadedImage">)
A <canvas id="overlayCanvas"> positioned absolutely on top (same width/height as image).
The canvas is where you render:
Two draggable scale markers for the reference object:
Left edge of the card
Right edge of the card
Two draggable pupil markers:
Left pupil
Right pupil
Each marker should be a circle or small handle drawn in canvas.
User flow:
Step 2:
Instruction text:
“Drag the yellow markers to the left and right edges of your card (credit card = 85.6mm wide).”
Input field for reference width with default 85.6 mm (user can edit if using a different object).
Step 3:
Instruction text:
“Now drag the blue markers to the center of each pupil.”
Render different colors for clarity:
Scale markers: yellow
Pupil markers: blue
Add subtle labels next to them (“Card Left”, “Card Right”, “Left Pupil”, “Right Pupil”).
D. PD Result Panel
Below the canvas:
A button: Calculate PD
Disabled until image is loaded and all markers are placed at least once.
When clicked:
Compute PD and show in a result box.
Result box:
Large text: Your PD: 63.5 mm (example)
Subtext:
“This is an approximate measurement. For medical use or complex prescriptions, consult your optician.”
Optionally show:
“Monocular PD (Left): XX mm”
“Monocular PD (Right): YY mm”
(calculate from each pupil to center of nose by letting user place an optional “nose center” marker; if you want to keep V1 simple, skip monocular PD).
Button: Copy PD (copies numeric PD value to clipboard).
2.3 APE / VCM OS CTA Block
Dark band similar to your other tools.
Title: Turn Tools Like This Into Income
Text:
“VCM OS and APE (Auto Paywall Everything) let you launch and monetize your own online tools with paywalls, tips, and subscriptions—no coding required.”
Button: Explore VCM OS & APE linking to your ecosystem landing page (href="https://your-url-here" or # placeholder).
2.4 SEO Content Section
Long-form copy beneath the tool card, targeting keyword variants.
Use headings:
H2: What Is Pupillary Distance (PD)?
Explain PD, why it matters for glasses, mono vs binocular PD.
H2: How This Online PD Measurement Tool Works
Step-by-step description of using a photo + card reference.
Emphasize everything is processed in the browser (privacy benefit).
H2: How Accurate Is an Online PD Tool?
Explain it’s approximate, good for typical distance prescriptions, but complex prescriptions should still use optician measurements.
H2: Tips for Getting the Most Accurate PD
Use high-resolution photo
Face the camera directly
Don’t tilt your head
Use a real credit card or standard-sized card
Avoid wide-angle distortion by not being too close to the camera
Sprinkle keyword phrases naturally:
“online tool to measure PD”
“measure your pupillary distance online”
“PD measurement tool”
“how to measure PD at home”
At the bottom, small disclaimer:
“This tool is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for a professional eye exam or optician measurement.”
3. PD Calculation Logic (app.js)
All logic in public/app.js.
3.1 Setup
On DOMContentLoaded:
Grab references to:
File input
Image element
Canvas and its context
Result elements
Buttons and reference width input
When a file is selected:
Read via FileReader as Data URL.
Set uploadedImage.src = reader.result.
On uploadedImage.onload, set canvas dimensions to match image’s rendered size.
Initialize default marker positions (rough guesses) and draw overlays.
3.2 Markers Data Structure
Create an array of marker objects like:
const markers = [
  { id: 'cardLeft', x: 100, y: 100, color: 'yellow' },
  { id: 'cardRight', x: 300, y: 100, color: 'yellow' },
  { id: 'pupilLeft', x: 150, y: 150, color: 'blue' },
  { id: 'pupilRight', x: 250, y: 150, color: 'blue' },
];
3.3 Drag & Drop Logic
Add mousedown, mousemove, mouseup (and touch equivalents) on the canvas.
On mousedown, check if click is inside any marker (distance < radius).
If so, set activeMarker = that marker.
On mousemove, if activeMarker is set, update its x,y to cursor position and redrawCanvas().
On mouseup, clear activeMarker.
3.4 Drawing Function
function redrawCanvas():
Clear canvas.
Draw the image onto canvas (ctx.drawImage(uploadedImage, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)).
For each marker:
Draw a circle (radius ~8–10px) filled/stroked in its color.
Optionally, draw small text labels near each marker.
Optionally, draw lines:
Between cardLeft and cardRight
Between pupilLeft and pupilRight
3.5 PD Computation
On Calculate PD click:
Compute pixel distances:
const cardWidthPx = distanceBetween(markers.cardLeft, markers.cardRight);
const pupilWidthPx = distanceBetween(markers.pupilLeft, markers.pupilRight);
Get reference width in mm:
const referenceMm = parseFloat(referenceInput.value) || 85.6;
Compute scale factor:
const mmPerPixel = referenceMm / cardWidthPx;
const pdMm = pupilWidthPx * mmPerPixel;
Round to 1 decimal place:
const pdRounded = Math.round(pdMm * 10) / 10;
Display PD result:
Update result text:
Your PD: 63.5 mm
If cardWidthPx or pupilWidthPx are invalid (NaN or too small), show an error: “Please make sure all markers are placed correctly.”
3.6 Copy PD Button
On click:
navigator.clipboard.writeText(pdRounded.toString())
Show a small toast or inline text: “Copied to clipboard”.
4. Styling (Tailwind)
Use Tailwind classes:
Body: bg-slate-50 text-slate-900
Container: max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-10
Card: bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-md p-6 md:p-8
Buttons:
Primary: bg-amber-400 hover:bg-amber-500 text-slate-900 font-semibold rounded-full px-5 py-2 transition
Secondary: border border-slate-300 rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm
Canvas wrapper: relative w-full max-w-xl mx-auto mt-4
SEO copy: prose prose-slate max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-10 (or hand-roll basic typography if not using Tailwind Typography).
Make sure the layout collapses nicely on mobile and canvas scales responsively.
5. Footer
Small footer:
Text:
“Part of the VCM creator tools stack. Build and monetize tools like this with APE and VCM OS.”
Links (placeholders ok):
“More Free Tools”
“APE – Auto Paywall Everything”
“VCM OS Overview”
Deliverable:
A working Replit project where visiting / loads a Free Online PD Measurement Tool that:
lets users upload a selfie
drag markers on a card and their pupils
calculates PD in mm
shows results clearly
includes a disclaimer
and funnels users into APE / VCM OS via a CTA section.
