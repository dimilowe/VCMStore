CORE FEATURE: FREE CALORIE COUNTER (FOOD INTAKE)

The calculator is general-purpose, NOT just walking or exercise.

Place the tool above the fold on `index.html`, right after the H1.

Inputs (in `index.html`, wired in `app.js`):
- A dynamic “meal list” where users can:
  - Add rows with:
    - Food name (text, optional for the math)
    - Calories (number, required per row)
  - Button: “Add food item”
- Alternatively, provide a simpler mode:
  - A single numeric input: “Total calories eaten today” (optional).
- Toggle: “Use multiple food items” vs “Use total calories only”.

Logic:
- If user adds multiple items:
  - Sum all calorie values.
- If they use “total only”:
  - Use that number directly.
- Always show:
  - Total calories consumed.
  - Optionally, compare to some generic goal:
    - Default maintenance estimate: 2,000 kcal.
    - Show messages like “Below / Around / Above a typical daily intake.”
- This is a lightweight free calorie tally, not a full macro tracker.

Validation:
- Calories for each item must be > 0 and < 5,000.
- Show inline error messages beside invalid inputs.

Output (results card):
- “Total calories consumed: XXXX kcal”
- Short interpretation string:
  - Example: “Compared to a typical 2,000 kcal day, you’re slightly above/below/around average.”
- Note: “This free calorie counter is for rough tracking only and is not medical advice.”

UX:
- Support adding/removing rows for food items.
- “Clear all” button resets the list and result.
- When “Calculate” is pressed, scroll smoothly to the results card if it’s below the fold.

DESIGN / LAYOUT

- Centered main container, max width ~900–1000px.
- Responsive on mobile.
- Use a single Google Font (Inter, Roboto, or similar).
- Clean card layout for:
  - Calculator
  - Results
  - Recommended tools
- Buttons should look modern, with hover states (no ugly defaults).
