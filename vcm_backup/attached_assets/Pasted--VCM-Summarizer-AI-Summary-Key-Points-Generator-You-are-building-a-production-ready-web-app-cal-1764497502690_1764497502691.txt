Core Functionality
1. Landing Page (GET /)
Render an HTML page (via index.ejs) with:
Title tag:
Free Summarizer Generator | AI Text Summarizer & Key Points Extractor
Meta description:
Use this free AI summarizer generator to instantly summarize any text and extract key takeaways. Paste your article, essay, or notes and get a clean summary in seconds.
H1:
Free AI Summarizer Generator
Short intro paragraph explaining what the tool does, naturally using the words:
“summarizer”
“summarizer generator”
“AI summarizer”
“text summarizer”
Example intro:
“VCM Summarizer is a free AI summarizer generator. Paste any article, essay, or document and our AI text summarizer will produce a clear summary and bullet-point key takeaways in seconds.”
Form with:
<textarea name="inputText" required> for the text to summarize (large, multi-line)
Optional checkbox:
name="simpleMode" label: “Explain it in simpler language”
Optional checkbox:
name="bulletsOnly" label: “Make the summary mostly bullet points”
Submit button: “Generate Summary”
Under the form, add a small FAQ/SEO section using headings:
What is a summarizer generator?
How does an AI summarizer work?
What can I use this text summarizer for?
Keep answers short and natural, mentioning the target keywords 3–5 times across the page without stuffing.
2. Handle Form Submission (POST /summarize)
Route: POST /summarize
Parse form data:
inputText (string, required)
simpleMode (optional checkbox -> boolean)
bulletsOnly (optional checkbox -> boolean)
Validation:
If inputText is missing or shorter than ~200 characters, return user-friendly error and a link back.
If inputText is extremely long (e.g., > 8000 characters), either:
Truncate to a safe max (first 8000 chars) and note this clearly to the user on the result page, or
Reject with a message asking them to shorten the input.
(Truncating is fine for MVP.)
3. OpenAI Call
Use the OpenAI API (gpt-4.1-mini or similar) to generate output.
Import OpenAI from openai.
Initialize with process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY.
Build a single call with:
System message:
“You are a world-class summarizer. You turn long texts into clear, concise summaries and extract the most important key takeaways. You always preserve meaning but remove fluff, and you write in simple, direct language.”
User message should:
Include the raw inputText.
Include the settings simpleMode and bulletsOnly.
Ask the model to output strict JSON with this structure:
{
  "summary": "string",
  "takeaways": ["string", "string", "..."]
}
Instructions:
If simpleMode is true:
“Use simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences suitable for a general audience.”
If bulletsOnly is true:
“Make the summary primarily bullet points with very minimal paragraph text.”
Otherwise:
“Use 2–4 short paragraphs followed by 5–10 bullet-point key takeaways.”
Example pseudo-prompt:
Here is the text to summarize:
{{inputText}}  
Settings:
simpleMode: {{true/false}}
bulletsOnly: {{true/false}}
Create a concise summary.
Extract the 5–10 most important key takeaways as bullet points.
Output ONLY valid JSON in the following format exactly, with double quotes and no extra text:
{ "summary": "...", "takeaways": ["...", "..."] }
Parse the JSON with JSON.parse. Use try/catch and show an error if parsing fails.
4. Results Page (views/result.ejs)
Render a clean results page with:
<title>: Summary Result | Free AI Summarizer Generator
Heading: Your AI Summary
Sections:
Summary
Heading: Summary
Render the summary string.
Convert line breaks into <p> or <br> as needed.
Key Takeaways
Heading: Key Takeaways
Unordered list <ul><li> from takeaways.
Optional notice if input was truncated:
If you truncated the original text, show a small note:
“Note: Your input was very long, so we summarized the first X characters.”
Button / link:
“Summarize another text” → goes back to /.
Styling & UX
Create public/styles.css with:
Global font: system sans-serif.
Centered, max-width container: max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.5rem;
Nice large textarea:
width: 100%;
min-height: 250px;
Responsive layout for mobile:
No horizontal scroll.
Buttons full width on small screens.
Cards or subtle borders for “Summary” and “Key Takeaways” sections.
Basic header at top with app name: “VCM Summarizer”.
Show a very simple “loading” state:
Use small inline JS that, on form submit, disables the button and changes text to “Generating…”.
SEO Requirements
On /:
Use “summarizer” and “summarizer generator” naturally in:
Title tag
H1
First paragraph
At least one FAQ question
Include synonyms throughout:
“AI summarizer”
“text summarizer”
“summary tool”
Do NOT keyword-stuff. It should read naturally and help a human understand what the tool does.
Server & Config
Use express.static('public') to serve CSS.
Use express.urlencoded({ extended: true }) to parse form data.
Use dotenv to load environment variables in development.
App listens on process.env.PORT || 3000.
package.json scripts:
"start": "node index.js"
Error Handling
If OpenAI API fails or times out:
Show a friendly error message:
“Something went wrong while generating your summary. Please try again.”
Link back to /.
If the user submits empty or tiny input:
Show a message on / above the form.
Keep logs to the server console but don’t expose raw errors to the user.
The final app must be fully working:
User visits /
Pastes text, clicks submit
Server calls OpenAI
Results page shows Summary and Key Takeaways cleanly
User can go back and summarize something else
End of Replit prompt.
