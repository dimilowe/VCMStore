Build a simple, fast, browser-only web app called **VCM HEIC to JPG Converter**.

Goal: a free, client-side tool where users can upload one or more `.HEIC` photos and download them as `.JPG` images. No accounts, no database, no server-side processing. Everything happens locally in the browser for privacy and simplicity.

### Tech & Structure

- Static web app (no backend logic).
- Files:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `script.js`
- Use **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks like React).
- Conversion must be **client-side** only.
- Use a browser-compatible HEIC decoder such as:
  - `heic2any` or a similar library that can run entirely in the browser.
- Do NOT send image data to any backend.

### Core Features

1. **Upload Section**
   - Card at the top with:
     - Title: **“Upload HEIC Photos”**
     - File input:
       ```html
       <input type="file" accept=".heic,image/heic,image/heif" multiple>
       ```
     - Below the input, show:
       - Number of selected files
       - Total size (e.g. “3 files · 8.2 MB”)
   - Validation:
     - Max files: 20 per batch.
     - Max size per file: 25 MB.
     - Show a clear error message if:
       - No files are selected when user tries to convert.
       - A file exceeds the size limit.
       - File type is not HEIC/HEIF.

2. **File List & Status**
   - After selecting files, show a list:
     - Filename
     - Size
     - Status badge: “Ready”, “Converting…”, “Done”, or “Error”.
   - Use a simple table or list layout for this.
   - Status should update in real time during conversion.

3. **Conversion Controls**
   - A settings panel with:
     - Output quality slider: 50–100 (default 85).
     - Output size option:
       - Radio buttons:
         - “Original size”
         - “Resize by longest side (px)” with a number input (default 2000, min 500, max 4000).
   - A primary button:
     - **“Convert to JPG”**
   - When converting:
     - Disable the button.
     - Show a progress indicator at the top or near the button:
       - Text like “Converting 1 of 5 images…”
       - A simple progress bar that fills as each file finishes.

4. **Download Handling**
   - After each file converts:
     - Create a `.jpg` Blob and trigger a download automatically **or** show a “Download JPG” button next to each file row.
     - Filenames should preserve the original name where possible: `originalname.jpg`.
   - If multiple files are selected:
     - Provide a “Download All as ZIP” button.
       - Use a client-side ZIP library (like JSZip) to bundle all converted JPGs into a single ZIP.
   - Show summary text after conversion:
     - “Converted 5 of 5 files successfully.”
     - If some failed, mention them explicitly.

5. **Error Handling**
   - For any file that fails conversion:
     - Mark its status as “Error” in red.
     - Show a brief tooltip or message like “Could not decode this HEIC file. Try another image or a smaller size.”
   - A global error banner at the top if something unexpected happens during the batch.

6. **Performance & Limits**
   - Handle large images gracefully:
     - If a file is extremely large (> 25 MB or resolution beyond a safe threshold), warn the user and suggest resizing.
   - Ensure that converting a typical batch (e.g. 10 phone photos) does not freeze the tab:
     - Convert files sequentially (one after the other) instead of all at once.
     - Yield back to the event loop between conversions so the UI stays responsive.

### Layout & Design

Overall style: clean, utility-focused, modern.

- Background: light neutral (#f5f5f5 or similar).
- Center content with max-width ~960px and generous padding.
- Use cards with rounded corners and soft shadows for:
  - Upload section
  - Settings + Convert button
  - Results / Downloads
- Typography:
  - Use a system UI font stack.
  - Clear hierarchy:
    - Main H1
    - Section titles (H2/H3)
    - Smaller captions for hints and errors.
- Buttons:
  - Primary button in a bold color (e.g. purple).
  - Hover and disabled states.
- Mobile responsiveness:
  - On mobile, cards stack vertically.
  - File list is scrollable horizontally if needed.

### SEO & Copy Requirements

In the `<head>` of `index.html`, include:

- `<title>Free HEIC to JPG Converter – Online & Private | VCM Suite</title>`
- `<meta name="description" content="Free online HEIC to JPG converter. Convert iPhone HEIC photos to JPG directly in your browser. No upload, no watermark, no signup. Powered by VCM Suite creator tools.">`
- Open Graph tags:
  - `<meta property="og:title" content="Free HEIC to JPG Converter – Online & Private | VCM Suite">`
  - `<meta property="og:description" content="Convert HEIC images to JPG for free in your browser. No watermark, no signup.">`

On the page:

- Main H1:
  - **Free HEIC to JPG Converter – Online & Private**
- Short intro paragraph under H1 presenting benefits:
  - Works in browser, no watermark, great for converting iPhone photos for use on the web, social media, etc.

Add a **FAQ section** under the tool for SEO. Include questions like:

1. “Is this HEIC to JPG converter free?”
2. “Are my HEIC photos uploaded to a server?”
3. “Does this converter add a watermark?”
4. “Why do iPhone photos use HEIC instead of JPG?”
5. “Can I convert multiple HEIC files at once?”

Answers should emphasize:

- 100% free.
- Files stay in the browser, not uploaded to a server.
- No watermark added.
- Batch conversion supported.
- Useful for creators, bloggers, and anyone using iPhone photos on other platforms.

### VCM Suite CTA Section

At the bottom of the page (below the FAQs), add a dedicated CTA card:

- Title: **“More Free Tools for Creators – VCM Suite”**
- Short paragraph explaining:
  - VCM Suite offers free tools, systems, and apps to help creators grow and monetize their work (image tools, GIF tools, marketing utilities, etc.).
- Button:
  - Text: **“Explore VCM Suite Tools”**
  - Link: `https://vcmsuite.com` (open in a new tab).

Design this CTA as a nice, visually separated card with a slightly stronger accent but do not overpower the converter UI.

---

### UX Details & Polishing

- Clear, visible error messages near problematic inputs.
- Disable “Convert to JPG” when:
  - No files selected.
  - Conversion is in progress.
- After conversion, allow users to:
  - Add more files to the list.
  - Re-run conversion with new settings without reloading the page.
- Show a small text note under the upload input:
  - “Tip: You can drag and drop HEIC files here.”
- Implement drag-and-drop:
  - Users can drag files into a highlighted drop zone.
  - The drop zone should visually change on drag-over.

---

### Implementation Notes

In `script.js`:

- Handle:
  - File selection and drag-and-drop.
  - Validation and file list rendering.
  - Calling the HEIC decode library for each file.
  - Converting the decoded image to JPEG with configurable quality and size.
  - Creating download links or triggering automatic downloads.
  - (Optional but preferred) Packaging multiple JPGs into a ZIP using a library like JSZip.

In `style.css`:

- Keep structure organized:
  - General layout
  - Card styles
  - Buttons
  - File list
  - Progress bar
  - Error/success states
  - Responsive rules

---

### Final Checklist

Before you consider the project complete, verify:

- Single HEIC → JPG conversion works on desktop browser.
- Batch conversion for multiple HEIC files works.
- No file is uploaded to any external server during conversion (only library scripts load).
- Error handling is clear and user-friendly.
- Title, meta description, OG tags, H1, FAQs, and VCM Suite CTA are all present and correct.
- Layout is responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Converted JPGs open correctly in common image viewers and can be used on social media, blogs, etc.

This should result in a polished **VCM HEIC to JPG Converter** that works as a standalone free tool, drives SEO traffic, and funnels users into the broader VCM Suite ecosystem.
