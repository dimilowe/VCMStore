CORE FEATURE: TREADMILL CALORIE COUNTER

This is an *exercise calorie* calculator specifically tailored to treadmill workouts.

Place calculator directly under H1 on `index.html`.

Inputs:
- Weight (kg, with toggle for lb → converted to kg internally).
- Workout duration (minutes).
- Treadmill speed (either km/h or mph; provide a toggle).
- Incline (%).
- Optional: activity mode select:
  - “Walk”
  - “Jog”
  - “Run”
  - “Intervals”

Logic (in `app.js`):

Simplified but realistic calculation using METs:
- Base MET by speed:
  - 3–4 km/h (~2–2.5 mph): MET ≈ 2.5–3
  - 5–6 km/h (~3–3.7 mph): MET ≈ 3.8–4.3
  - 7–8 km/h (~4.3–5 mph): MET ≈ 6.0–8.3
  - 9+ km/h (~5.6+ mph): MET ≈ 9–11
- Adjust MET upwards slightly based on incline:
  - +0.5 MET for each 5% incline (keep it simple and capped to avoid absurd values).

Calories formula:
- `Calories = MET × 3.5 × weight_kg / 200 × minutes`

Also calculate:
- Distance:
  - If using km/h:
    - `distance_km = speed_kmh × (minutes / 60)`
  - If mph:
    - Convert to km/h internally but present both km and miles.
- Pace info (min per km or min per mile).

Validation:
- Weight must be > 30kg and < 200kg.
- Minutes > 1 and ≤ 240.
- Speed > 1 and < 25 (reasonable treadmill range).
- Incline between 0 and 15%.

Output (in a result card):
- “Estimated calories burned on the treadmill: XXX kcal”
- “Distance: X.X km (Y.Y miles)”
- “Average pace: Z minutes per km (and per mile)”
- Optional summary text:
  - “This puts you in the light / moderate / vigorous intensity range.”
- Disclaimer: “These are estimates based on standard formulas and don’t replace professional advice.”

UX:
- When “Calculate” is clicked and inputs are valid:
  - Scroll to the result card smoothly.
- If invalid:
  - Highlight the first invalid input and show a small red error below it.
- Add a “Reset” link to clear form and result.

DESIGN / LAYOUT

- Look and feel similar to the other MBBs:
  - Centered container, max width ~900–1000px.
  - Clean cards, good spacing, mobile-friendly.
- Use one Google Font.
- Treadmill/fitness visual vibe but no heavy images required (keep it fast).
