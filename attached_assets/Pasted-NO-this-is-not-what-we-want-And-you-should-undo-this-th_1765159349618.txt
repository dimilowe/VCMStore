NO — this is not what we want.
And you should undo this thinking immediately before it causes long-term SEO damage.
Let me break it down cleanly and decisively:
❌ 1. You should NOT auto-index everything in /tools, /blog, /product, etc.
Your entire architecture is built around manual, controlled indexing.
Why?
You generate hundreds of pages.
Many are drafts, placeholders, or incomplete MBB shells.
Many should NEVER be publicly indexed.
Many have 0 content until you approve them.
Many are thin or unoptimized until you fix them.
If Google crawls those prematurely, it WILL punish your entire site.
Premature mass indexing =
Panda-level thin content penalty (yes, it still exists under other names).
This is why we designed:
isIndexed flag
Manual toggling
Review-first workflow
Admin panel checks
The system EXPECTS you to approve what enters Google.
This SQL blast overrides all of that.
❌ 2. Auto-indexing “50 core pages” is based on a false assumption
Just because something lives in a folder or URL path does NOT mean it’s ready for SEO.
A page’s path has nothing to do with its readiness.
Only CMS object quality determines readiness.
Indexing decisions must be:
intentional
selective
tied to quality
tied to interlinking
connected to your roll-out strategy
Not based on what folder something is in.
❌ 3. This breaks your entire traffic strategy
You don’t want:
100 half-complete pages
100 unoptimized titles
100 thin pages
100 duplicate patterns
…landing in Google.
Your whole magic power is controlled release.
Index 5–20 pages a week.
Not 50 at once.
❌ 4. The SEO scanner is supposed to ONLY scan pages you approve
The scanner’s rule is correct:
Scan only pages marked isIndexed = true in CMS.
Do NOT flip that rule.
Do NOT mass-toggle everything to ON.
We created the toggle to PROTECT you.
And now it’s been bypassed.
❌ 5. What we SHOULD do instead
Here is the correct workflow:
STEP 1 — Reset all incorrectly indexed pages
We need to revert the mass update.
You should set ALL pages back to isIndexed = false
except:
Homepage (/)
Blog index (/blog)
Store index (/store)
Tools index (/tools)
These are safe to leave indexed.
Everything else should be OFF until reviewed.
If you want, I can give you the SQL to revert it safely.
❌ 6. The correct way to index pages is:
Workflow:
Generate CMS objects
Review the content
Interlink them
Ensure:
metadata is good
schema exists
word count is healthy
not thin
not duplicate
THEN toggle isIndexed = true
THEN the SEO scanner picks them up
THEN they enter your sitemap
This is the whole GAME.
This is the architecture you built.
Don’t shortcut it.
❌ 7. So is what happened “bad”?
It’s not catastrophic — but it’s not correct, and we should revert before Google crawls the wrong stuff.
