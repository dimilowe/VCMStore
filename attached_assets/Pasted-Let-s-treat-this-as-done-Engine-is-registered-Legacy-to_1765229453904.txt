Let’s treat this as done:
Engine is registered ✅
Legacy tool untouched ✅
Engine selection via { engine: 'outfit', preset: '...' } ✅
Now you just need a presets map and some CMS tool entries to light up the cluster.
1. Presets map for engines/outfit/config.ts
I’ll assume your OutfitEngineConfig looks roughly like:
slug
title
subtitle
badgeLabel
badgeIcon?
uploadTitle
uploadDescription?
uploadHelpText
apiPath
faqs
If your field names differ slightly, just adjust – the copy/structure is what matters.
Add something like this to engines/outfit/config.ts:
import type { OutfitEngineConfig } from './types-or-interface-file';

export const BASE_FAQS: OutfitEngineConfig['faqs'] = [
  {
    q: 'How does this outfit finder work?',
    a: 'Upload any outfit photo and our AI analyzes it to identify items like tops, pants, shoes, and accessories. For each item, we generate search keywords and find similar products from shopping sites so you can recreate the look.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this outfit generator free?',
    a: 'Yes, this outfit ideas tool is 100% free to use. No signup or account required. Just upload a photo and get instant shopping suggestions.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What kind of photos work best?',
    a: 'Clear, well-lit photos work best. Full-body outfit shots, Instagram fashion posts, celebrity looks, or Pinterest inspiration boards all work great. The AI can identify multiple items in a single photo.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I use screenshots from social media?',
    a: 'Yes. You can upload screenshots from Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, or any site. The AI will identify shoppable items and find similar products.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Are the product links always exact matches?',
    a: 'We look for visually similar items. Prices and availability may vary. Always double-check details on the retailer’s website before purchasing.'
  }
];

If your file already defines two presets, you can just lift the new keys (3–12) and drop them into your existing OUTFIT_PRESETS map.
2. CMS tool entries (how you actually use them)
For each preset you want live, the CMS tool just needs:
{
  "type": "tool",
  "slug": "date-night-outfit-generator",          // must match route
  "title": "Date Night Outfit Generator – Recreate Any Romantic Look",
  "description": "Upload a date-night outfit photo and get AI-powered shoppable matches.",
  "engine": "outfit",
  "engine_config": {
    "engine": "outfit",
    "preset": "date-night-outfit-generator"       // <– key in OUTFIT_PRESETS
  },
  "seo_title": "Date Night Outfit Generator – Recreate Any Romantic Look with AI",
  "seo_description": "Upload a date-night outfit photo and instantly find similar shoppable items using AI.",
  "interlink_parent": "fashion-outfit-tools",
  "interlink_siblings": [
    "outfit-ideas-ai",
    "streetwear-outfit-finder",
    "office-outfit-generator"
  ],
  "interlink_tools": []
}
Repeat that pattern for any preset key from OUTFIT_PRESETS.
