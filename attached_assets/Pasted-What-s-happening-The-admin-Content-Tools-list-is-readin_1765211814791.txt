What’s happening:
The admin “Content → Tools” list is reading from cms_objects. That’s where your 7 ZIP tools live.
The All Tools A–Z page you screenshotted is **still reading from the old tools table**, not from cms_objects, and it doesn’t care about Indexed` at all.
Those “Calorie Deficit Calculator / Emoji Combos / etc.” tools exist in the tools table, which is why they show up even though they’re not indexed in the URL registry.
So:
Indexed controls SEO/sitemap.
The A–Z directory is still using the legacy tools table.
Your ZIP tools:
✅ Exist in cms_objects
✅ Render fine on /tools/[slug]
❌ Don’t exist in tools table
→ Therefore they don’t appear in the legacy directory.
What we should do (one-time architecture fix)
We want one content truth: cms_objects for tools as well.
1️⃣ Update All Tools directory to read from cms_objects
Give this to Replit:
The All Tools A–Z directory is still using the legacy `tools` table. I’ve migrated tool content into `cms_objects` and I want the directory to use `cms_objects` as the single source of truth.

Please:

1. Find the route for the All Tools listing page (the A–Z directory, e.g. `app/tools/page.tsx` or similar).

2. Create a helper, e.g. `lib/cms/getAllCmsTools.ts`, that:
   - Queries the `cms_objects` table
   - Filters rows where `type = 'tool'`
   - Returns the fields needed to render the directory (slug, title, description, engine_config, cluster/category if available).

3. Update the All Tools page to use `getAllCmsTools` instead of reading from the legacy `tools` table.
   - Keep the current A–Z grouping and category pills, but drive them from the CMS data.
   - Ensure that tools like `zip-file-in-linux`, etc. from `cms_objects` appear in the list once this change is made.

4. Do NOT reintroduce or depend on the `tools` table for rendering. The content truth for tools should now be `cms_objects` only.

5. Make sure the page still compiles and loads correctly.
Once that’s done, your 7 ZIP tools will show up in the master directory automatically.
2️⃣ About the “Links = ❌” column
That X just means: “No internal links detected yet.”
Cluster = None + no pillar/articles ⇒ there’s nothing linking in/out, so X is expected.
A cluster prompt would have generated:
a Zip Tools cluster object
pillar + support articles with interlink metadata
internal links between tools + articles
→ those would start flipping to ✅ as pages go live.
You can:
Create a Zip Tools cluster now and assign these 7 tools to it (good housekeeping), then
Later run a full cluster prompt for ZIP, import the articles, and the link checker will start going green as actual links exist.
