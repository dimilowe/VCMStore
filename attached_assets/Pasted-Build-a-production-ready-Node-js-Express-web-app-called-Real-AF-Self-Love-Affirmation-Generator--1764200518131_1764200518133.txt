User prompt template:
“Write {count} affirmations about self love for someone focused on the area: {AREA}. Tone: {TONE} where tone is one of: gentle, hype, brutal.
Rules:
Each affirmation must start with ‘I’.
Keep each affirmation under 20 words.
Make them specific, grounded, and modern.
‘Brutal’ can be tough-love but never insulting.”
Return them as a simple \n-separated string; the server splits into a list.
