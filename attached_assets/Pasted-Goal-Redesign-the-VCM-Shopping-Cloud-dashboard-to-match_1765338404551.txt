Goal: Redesign the VCM Shopping Cloud dashboard to match an Adobe Creative Cloud–style layout, but in a white/light theme, without touching any forbidden core files. This is a purely visual/layout refactor – all existing logic, entitlements, and routing must remain intact.

High-level target

I want the Shopping Cloud home page to look like a white-themed version of the Adobe Cloud home:

- Large hero banner at the top (big headline + subheadline)
- Under the hero, a row of 3 primary “app” cards (for the main Shopping Cloud tools)
- Below that, a row of category filter tabs (Featured, AI Tools, Style Tools, Boards, etc.)
- Below the tabs, a grid of featured tools
- On the right side, a “Recent files” sidebar similar to Adobe’s Recent Files rail
- Overall: white background, soft gray panels, rounded corners, subtle shadows, clean Apple/Adobe aesthetic

VERY IMPORTANT – Editing Rules / Allowed Zones

Follow these rules strictly. Do NOT violate them.

Forbidden (ABSOLUTE LOCKED ZONES – READ ONLY, NO WRITES)
- components/renderer/**
- lib/vcmRenderer/**
- lib/vcm-renderer/**
- Any file containing ANY of these identifiers: Renderer, renderEngine, VCMRenderer, resolveConfig, resolveCmsObject
- app/globals.css
- lib/db.ts
- engine registries: lib/engineRegistry.ts, data/toolsRegistry.ts
- Any CMS resolver / low-level routing code

The codebase is currently light-theme only.
- Do NOT use any Tailwind `dark:` variants anywhere.
- Do NOT introduce global theme switches or new color modes.

Allowed (YOU MAY EDIT / CREATE)
- app/clouds/** (Shopping Cloud page and its immediate layout)
- components/clouds/**
- components/cards/**
- components/ui/** (if such generic UI components exist)
- Any new components you create under components/clouds/ or components/cards/ that are used ONLY for layout/visual purposes

No global CSS changes:
- All styling must be done with Tailwind utility classes in JSX/TSX.
- Do NOT edit app/globals.css or Tailwind config.

Functional constraints

- DO NOT change any business logic, entitlements, or API calls.
- DO NOT change any engine configs or CMS data contracts.
- You can refactor JSX structure and Tailwind classes, and create new presentational components, but the underlying data (which tools are shown, recent files, etc.) must remain the same.
- All existing links, tool slugs, and click behavior must continue to work.

Layout to implement for the Shopping Cloud page

1) Identify the Shopping Cloud page
- Find the current page component that renders the Shopping Cloud: likely something like `app/clouds/shopping-cloud/page.tsx` or similar.
- Confirm this is the file currently rendering the “VCM Shopping Cloud” hero and the list of tools.
- This will be the main entry point you refactor.

2) Create a composed layout

Refactor the Shopping Cloud page to use a high-level layout like:

- A full-width main container with white background.
- Inside, a two-column layout:
  - Left: main content (hero + sections)
  - Right: Recent Files sidebar

Rough structure (you will translate this into real TSX):

<main className="min-h-screen bg-white">
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto flex gap-8 px-6 py-10">
    <section className="flex-1 flex flex-col gap-10">
      <ShoppingCloudHero />
      <ShoppingCloudPrimaryCards />
      <ShoppingCloudCategoryTabs />
      <ShoppingCloudFeaturedTools />
    </section>
    <aside className="w-80 hidden lg:block">
      <ShoppingCloudRecentFiles />  // reuse existing data logic, new UI
    </aside>
  </div>
</main>

Create the needed components under components/clouds/:

- components/clouds/ShoppingCloudHero.tsx
- components/clouds/ShoppingCloudPrimaryCards.tsx
- components/clouds/ShoppingCloudCategoryTabs.tsx
- components/clouds/ShoppingCloudFeaturedTools.tsx
- components/clouds/ShoppingCloudRecentFiles.tsx (wrap existing recent files logic in a nicer UI)

If some of these already exist, refactor them instead of creating duplicates. Keep imports clean.

3) Hero Section – white Adobe style

Implement a hero similar to Adobe’s but on white:

- Full-width section with soft gradient from white to zinc-50
- Headline: “VCM Shopping Cloud”
- Subheadline: brief pitch about outfit generators, styling boards, and shoppable tools
- Optional small pill tag “PRO” near the title
- Use Tailwind classes like:

  - Container: `bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-zinc-50 rounded-b-3xl border-b border-zinc-200 px-6 py-10`
  - Title: `text-4xl font-bold text-zinc-900 tracking-tight`
  - Subheadline: `text-lg text-zinc-600 max-w-xl mt-3`

Do NOT use dark mode variants.

4) Primary Cards Row – 3 Adobe-like app cards

Under the hero, add a row of 3 main cards for key Shopping Cloud tools (e.g. outfit finder, track price, Amazon tracker).

- 1 row, responsive:
  - `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Card styling:

  - `bg-white border border-zinc-200 rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition`
  - Title: `text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mb-2`
  - Description: `text-sm text-zinc-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed`
  - Buttons row: `flex gap-3`
    - “Open tool” button: neutral border button (`border border-zinc-300 text-zinc-800 bg-white`)
    - “View plans” button: gradient (`bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-orange-400 text-white`)

Make sure each card links to the correct tool slug (reuse existing tool metadata – don’t hardcode raw URLs if there is already a registry or CMS object to derive from).

5) Category Tabs Row

Add a horizontal tab row similar to Adobe’s category bar:

- Example labels: “Featured”, “AI Tools”, “Style Tools”, “Boards”
- Styling:

  - Container: `flex gap-3 mt-8 overflow-x-auto pb-1`
  - Tab button (non-active): `px-4 py-2 text-sm rounded-full border border-zinc-300 bg-white text-zinc-700 hover:bg-zinc-100`
  - Active tab: `bg-zinc-900 text-white border-zinc-900` or use the gradient as accent

For now, it’s fine if these are cosmetic only (no need to implement full filtering yet) **as long as you don’t break any existing logic**. If there is already filtering logic, wire tabs into that; otherwise they can be static UI.

6) Featured Tools Grid

Refactor the existing tool list into a clean grid:

- Layout: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-8`
- Each tool card should:

  - Be a `Link` to the tool’s page
  - Use card styling similar to:

    - Container: `bg-zinc-50 border border-zinc-200 rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition h-full flex flex-col`
    - Top “image” or gradient block: `h-32 rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-br from-zinc-100 to-zinc-200 mb-4`
    - Tool title: `text-lg font-semibold text-zinc-900 mb-1`
    - Tool description: `text-sm text-zinc-600 flex-1`
    - Optional: small badge for “Pro feature” if the tool requires Shopping Cloud Pro (but do NOT change the entitlement logic)

Do NOT alter how tools are fetched or determined; only change the JSX layout and classes around them.

7) Recent Files Sidebar

Wrap the existing recent files logic in a nicer visual shell on the right side:

- A panel with:

  - Container: `bg-white border border-zinc-200 rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-sm h-full flex flex-col`
  - Title: `text-lg font-semibold text-zinc-900 mb-4`
  - List: scrollable section with `flex flex-col gap-3 overflow-y-auto max-h-[600px]`

- Each recent file row:

  - `flex gap-3 items-center p-3 rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 hover:bg-zinc-50 transition`
  - Thumbnail square (if available) or file-type badge
  - File name: `text-sm font-semibold text-zinc-900`
  - Subtext: `text-xs text-zinc-500`

Use the existing recent files data source; do NOT introduce new persistence or change how memory/entitlements are handled. Free users should still see files they created, consistent with current behavior.

8) Responsiveness

Ensure:

- On mobile (smaller screens):

  - Sidebar hides (`hidden lg:block`)
  - Content becomes a single column
  - Cards and grid stack nicely

- On desktop:

  - Two-column layout shows as described.

9) Clean up & verification

- NO `dark:` Tailwind classes anywhere in any newly edited components.
- NO changes to forbidden files (renderer, globals.css, engine registries, db, cms resolver).
- Run TypeScript check / build to ensure no type or import errors.
- Confirm that:
  - Shopping Cloud page loads with the new layout
  - All existing tools still open correctly
  - Recent files still function as before
  - No entitlements or logic behavior changed

Finally, summarize:

- List all files you created or modified.
- For each file, briefly describe what changed (UI-only) and confirm no core renderer/engine/CMS logic was touched.
