1. Lock in the architecture: how interlinking should work
Given what you already have:
clusterRegistry.ts with:
clusterSlug
toolSlugs[]
articleSlugs[]
Tools already have:
clusterSlug
pillarSlug
recommendedTools[]
AutomatedToolLinks exists and knows how to pull related tools
You’re one layer away from a proper lattice.
The final shape you want:
Pillar pages (per cluster)
URL: /tools/clusters/[clusterSlug]
Show: all tools + articles in that cluster
Every tool in the cluster links up to this page.
Category pages (per engine/topic)
URL: /tools/categories/[categorySlug] (or [engine]/[topic])
Show: all tools matching that engine/topic
Every tool links up to at least one category page.
Tool pages
Each tool:
links up → pillar page + at least one category page
shows sideways links → AutomatedToolLinks (siblings)
links into OS → bottom bar, creator tools, etc.
Admin preflight
Before you can set isIndexed = true, the code runs a validation check on those relationships.
2. What to build next (in order)
Step 1 – Dynamic pillar pages from clusterRegistry
Route example:
/tools/clusters/[clusterSlug].tsx
What it does:
Reads clusterRegistry[clusterSlug]
Grabs all tools in toolSlugs[]
Optionally grabs all articles from articleSlugs[]
Renders:
H1: cluster name
Short intro
Grid/list of tools in that cluster
“Related clusters” if you want later
Key requirement:
Each tool page that belongs to this cluster renders a link like:
“View all tools in this cluster” → /tools/clusters/${clusterSlug}
That gives you the upward link you were missing.
Step 2 – Category pages for engines/topics
You need one abstraction above clusters: categories.
Examples:
image-tools
social-media
finance-calculators
ai-tools
name-generators
Add a categorySlug field to your tool config (or derive it from engine + topic), and then:
Route example:
/tools/categories/[categorySlug].tsx
What it does:
Filters the tools registry by categorySlug
Renders:
H1: category name
Subcategories or clusters inside
List of tools with short descriptions
Each tool page should then:
Link up to at least one category page:
“See more tools like this” → /tools/categories/${categorySlug}
Now you have 2 guaranteed upward paths:
Tool → pillar
Tool → category
Step 3 – Pre-indexing validator (the safety net)
This is the piece your Replit output was already pointing at. Build a pure function first, then wire it into admin.
Function signature idea:
type LinkStatus = {
  hasPillar: boolean;
  hasCategory: boolean;
  hasSiblings: boolean;
  hasFunnelLinks: boolean;
};

function validateToolInterlinking(toolSlug: string): LinkStatus
What it should check:
Pillar check
Does the tool have a clusterSlug?
Does that clusterSlug exist in clusterRegistry?
Does the pillar route /tools/clusters/[clusterSlug] exist (or can be generated)?
Tool page includes a link up to that route (can be inferred from template, or you just assume it if you use one standard layout).
Category check
Does the tool have a categorySlug?
Does this category resolve to a category page?
Tool template includes a “category link” section.
Sibling check
In clusterRegistry, for this tool’s clusterSlug, are there at least 2–3 other toolSlugs?
Does AutomatedToolLinks for this cluster return ≥ N siblings (e.g., 3)?
(Reciprocal “linking” is automatically satisfied if every tool in the cluster uses the same AutomatedToolLinks component.)
Funnel (OS) check
Does this tool’s layout include:
bottom CTA bar
creator tools/OS block
or at least one OS-related CTA component
Minimal version:
Assume a single layout that always injects funnel modules → mark hasFunnelLinks = true for all.
Step 4 – Admin: show link status and block indexing
In your admin UI for tools/MBBs, add a column like:
Link Status
✅ Ready
⚠ Missing pillar
⚠ Missing category
⚠ Not enough siblings
⚠ No funnel
Flow:
When the admin loads the tool list:
For each tool, call validateToolInterlinking(toolSlug)
Show badges for each warning/ok status
When you try to toggle isIndexed from false → true:
Run validateToolInterlinking
If any required field is false:
Block save
Show a toast:
“Cannot index yet: missing pillar link / missing category / not enough siblings / missing funnel link.”
That’s your preflight.
3. How this actually behaves when you index 10 tools that day
Once this is implemented, your daily process looks like:
Go into admin.
Filter tools by:
isIndexed = false
linkStatus = Ready
Select 10 tools in a single cluster or related clusters.
Toggle isIndexed = true for those 10.
Because the preflight ensures:
they all link up to a pillar
they all link up to a category
they all show sibling tools
they all have OS/monetization CTAs
…Google is going to see clean clusters, not random junk.
No guesswork. No “I hope this is linked right.”
4. What I’d do right now, in this order
You want to keep it tight and not disappear into refactor hell:
Implement pillar pages
Small, lean, just list tools in the cluster.
Implement category pages
Derive simple categories and wire them into tool configs.
Update tool layout
Add:
“View all tools in this cluster” link
“More tools in this category” link
Make sure AutomatedToolLinks renders on all tool pages
Ensure funnel CTAs present
Implement validateToolInterlinking(toolSlug)
Keep it simple but strict.
Wire validation into admin
Status column
Block indexing on failure
Once that’s in, you can safely go from 261 → 700 → 1,000 tools without worrying you’re silently poisoning your domain.
