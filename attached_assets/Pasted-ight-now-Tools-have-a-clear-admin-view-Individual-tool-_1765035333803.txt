ight now:
Tools have a clear admin view
Individual tool pages have a clear status
But clusters (pillars + supporting articles + tools) do NOT have a unified, authoritative view.
This means you can’t see:
Which cluster is missing supporting articles
Which cluster is tool-heavy but article-light
Which supporting articles aren’t published yet
Which cluster is lopsided or incomplete
Whether the cluster has enough interlink density to dominate Google
And you’re right — you can’t “scale intelligently” if you don’t know what you’re building onto.
So here’s the clean solution.
✅ What You Need: A Cluster Control Panel
This becomes the third pillar of your SEO OS:
Tool Control Panel – tool-level control
MBB Control Panel – asset-level control
Cluster Control Panel – topical authority control ← You’re missing this
This new panel would show each cluster with:
1. The Pillar Page (anchor)
Title
URL
Index status
Word count
Last updated
Internal links in/out
Health score
Missing elements
2. Tools in the Cluster
A table like this:
Tool	Indexed	Ready?	In Directory	Interlinking Status	Preview
With filters:
show indexed only
show drafts
show not-ready
show missing schema
3. Supporting Articles
MOST IMPORTANT:
This view shows even non-indexed and draft articles.
Fields:
| Article | Status (draft/live) | Indexed | Word Count | Last Updated | Internal Links | Missing? |
This solves the pain you're describing directly.
4. Cluster Health Score (0–100)
Based on:
% of assets indexed
presence of supporting articles
topic coverage breadth
inbound/outbound link density
FAQ completeness
pillar depth
engine integration
This instantly tells you:
🔥 “This cluster is weak — add 3 articles.”
🔥 “This cluster is strong — index 5 more tools.”
🔥 “This cluster is missing a financial calculator.”
5. Cluster Map View (visual)
A literal graph:
Pillar
 ├─ Tools
 │   ├─ tool A
 │   ├─ tool B
 │   └─ tool C
 └─ Articles
      ├─ article X
      ├─ article Y
      └─ article Z
You can instantly see:
the full cluster
where you need more depth
which branches are sparse
what’s missing before indexing
6. Add-Assets Panel
Inside each cluster:
“Add new supporting article”
“Add new MBB tool”
“Add new generator for this cluster”
“Clone article template for pillar expansion”
This prevents cluster drift.
7. Indexing Dependency Checklist
For each cluster:
Index ON is only allowed when:
Pillar is stable & internally linked
Minimum 3 supporting articles
Tools complete interlink requirements
No broken links or missing schemas
The cluster is “sealed” properly
This protects your topical authority.
🎯 Why You Absolutely Need This
Without this tool you cannot do:
clean scaling
smart prioritization
intelligent cluster expansion
controlled indexing rollout
Right now you’re effectively flying blind above the individual page level.
Your architecture was built for macro-scale, but you still don’t have a macro-view.
This is the missing link.
