Yes. This is exactly where your leverage is.
You should upgrade CalculatorEngine and stop thinking about decorating tools one-by-one.
Right now:
Engine UI = barebones
Legacy tools = fully “VCM’d” (FAQ, ExploreMoreTools, upsells, schema, etc.)
You’ve just manufactured 10 new calculators that are structurally weak pages.
If you bulk-upgrade the engine once, all of these instantly jump to “money page” level.
What to add to CalculatorEngine (in order)
Do this as a single, reusable layout:
Hero + context block
Title from DB
Short description
Pill/label for metric + content_type
One sentence: what this calculator tells you and why it matters.
Form + result area (already there)
Just make sure copy is not hard-coded to CTR if it’s used for other metrics.
Your screenshot says “Average View Duration” in the title but the info text says “Measures how often viewers click…” — that’s CTR copy leaking into another metric. Fix that via presets.
FAQ section (engine-level)
Pull from a preset keyed by metric (and optionally content_type):
faqsByMetric["ctr"]
faqsByMetric["avg-view-duration"], etc.
Render FAQ component + FAQ JSON-LD.
ExploreMoreTools block
“Other YouTube Metric Calculators” list:
use cluster + siblings logic to show 3–6 related calculators.
This should live inside the engine so every calculator gets it.
PostResultUpsell
After the result, you drop your “creators, want more views/subs/conversions?” style CTA.
Same module you use elsewhere, but tuned to analytics intent:
“Turn these numbers into actual growth with [Nudge / QR Social / OS waitlist]”.
JSON-LD Schema
For calculators you can use:
SoftwareApplication OR a simple WebPage with FAQ.
Include:
name = tool title
description
applicationCategory = "BusinessApplication" / "Utility"
operatingSystem = "Web"
Tie FAQ JSON-LD to the same questions you render.
Related Content / Articles
From cluster + linkRules:
Show 1–3 related articles (even if “coming soon” at first).
This lives in the engine layout so all calculators benefit.
How to structure it so it doesn’t become a mess
Create a YOUTUBE_METRIC_PRESETS object:
const YOUTUBE_METRIC_PRESETS = {
  ctr: {
    badgeLabel: "CTR",
    explanation: "Measures how often people click...",
    faqs: [...],
  },
  retention: { ... },
  "avg-view-duration": { ... },
};
In CalculatorEngine, when tool.cluster === "youtube-metrics", read metric from tool.dimensions and pull the right preset.
The layout stays generic, only the copy changes per preset.
That gives you:
One upgraded CalculatorEngine
Per-metric customization without 10 bespoke components.
Bottom line
Yes, enhance CalculatorEngine now.
It’s way better use of time than hand-polishing 10 individual pages, and it instantly turns every current and future calculator shell (YouTube metrics + any future calc blueprints) into a full SEO + monetization page.
