Build a simple, fast, browser-only web app called **VCM GIF Maker**.

Goal: a free, client-side tool where users can upload a video OR a sequence of images, tweak a few settings, and download a GIF. No accounts, no database, no server-side processing. Everything happens locally in the browser for privacy and simplicity.

### Tech + Project Structure

- Make this a **static web app** (no backend logic needed).
- Files:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `script.js`
- Use **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks like React).
- You *may* use a client-side GIF/video library such as:
  - `ffmpeg.wasm` (preferred) OR
  - `gif.js` / `gifshot`
- All conversion must be **client-side**. Do NOT upload files to any server.

### Core Features

1. **Upload Sources Section**
   - A card at the top with:
     - Toggle buttons:
       - `Video to GIF`
       - `Images to GIF`
       - Only one active at a time; default is `Video to GIF`.
     - For `Video to GIF`:
       - `<input type="file" accept="video/*">`
       - Show selected file name below.
     - For `Images to GIF`:
       - `<input type="file" accept="image/*" multiple>`
       - Show the number of selected images and a horizontal thumbnail strip (small previews).
   - Validate:
     - Max file size per file: 100 MB.
     - Show a clear error if file is too big or wrong type.

2. **Preview Section**
   - For video:
     - Display a `<video>` element with controls and muted autoplay.
   - For images:
     - Display a simple slideshow preview or a note like “Preview will be generated in GIF output.”
   - If no file is selected, show a placeholder message: “Upload a video or images to start.”

3. **Settings Panel**
   - Right side or below preview.
   - Settings with sensible defaults:
     - Width (pixels) – number input, default 480, min 120, max 1280.
     - FPS (frames per second) – number input, default 12, min 5, max 30.
     - Duration limit (seconds) – number input, default 10. For video mode, if the video is longer, only the first N seconds are converted.
     - Loop:
       - Checkbox “Loop forever” (checked by default).
   - For video mode:
     - Start time input (seconds) so user can pick where to start in the video. Default 0.
   - A button: **“Reset Settings”** to revert to defaults.

4. **Generate GIF Flow**
   - Big primary button: **“Generate GIF”**.
   - When clicked:
     - Validate that a file is selected.
     - Disable the button while processing.
     - Show a progress UI:
       - A progress bar and text status:
         - “Initializing…”
         - “Extracting frames…”
         - “Encoding GIF…”
   - On success:
     - Show:
       - A GIF preview (`<img>` with the result).
       - A **Download** button that triggers download of the GIF file.
       - File size and dimensions text like: “Output: 480x270 · 2.3 MB”.
   - On failure:
     - Show a friendly error message box at the top of the tool, e.g. “Something went wrong while generating your GIF. Try a smaller file or lower width/FPS.”

5. **Performance + Limits**
   - For very large files:
     - If the source video length × FPS × width would clearly be too heavy, show a warning and suggest:
       - Lower FPS
       - Shorter duration
       - Smaller width
   - Ensure the app doesn’t crash the tab when converting ~5–10s 720p clips.

### Layout & Design

Overall vibe: clean, modern, tool-like. No need for heavy branding, but it should look professional.

- Page background: light neutral (#f5f5f5 or similar).
- Centered content with max-width ~960px and generous padding.
- Use a simple, modern font (e.g. system UI).
- Visual hierarchy:
  - H1 at top: **“Free GIF Maker – Video & Image to GIF”**
  - Short subtext: “Convert your videos or images into shareable GIFs directly in your browser.”
- Use cards with soft shadows and rounded corners for:
  - Upload section
  - Settings
  - Output
- Buttons:
  - Primary button in a bold color (e.g. purple).
  - Hover states for buttons.
- Display a tiny “processing…” spinner next to the Generate button when working.

### SEO & Copy Requirements

In `index.html` head, add:

- `<title>Free GIF Maker – Video to GIF & Image to GIF Converter | VCM Suite</title>`
- `<meta name="description" content="Free online GIF maker. Convert video to GIF or images to GIF directly in your browser. No watermark, no signup. Powered by VCM Suite creator tools.">`
- Open Graph tags:
  - `og:title` same as title.
  - `og:description` similar to meta description.
- Main H1 on page should be:  
  **Free GIF Maker – Video & Image to GIF Converter**
- Include a short FAQ section under the tool for SEO, with questions like:
  - “Is this GIF maker free?”
  - “Does this GIF tool add a watermark?”
  - “Are my files uploaded to a server?”
  - “Can I use this GIF maker for social media?”
- Answers should emphasize:
  - Free
  - No watermark
  - Files processed in browser (privacy)
  - Great for social media, messaging, blogs, etc.

### VCM Suite CTA Section

At the bottom of the page (below the tool and FAQ), add a clean CTA block:

- Title: **“Power your creator business with VCM Suite”**
- Short paragraph explaining:
  - VCM Suite offers free tools, systems, and apps for creators to grow and monetize.
- A button:
  - Text: **“Explore More Free Creator Tools”**
  - Link: `https://vcmsuite.com` (open in a new tab).

Make sure this CTA looks like a separate, nicely designed card, but doesn’t overshadow the GIF tool itself.

---

### UX Details & Polishing

- Show clear error messages near the relevant controls (e.g. if user tries to Generate with no file).
- Disable “Generate GIF” while processing to avoid double-click issues.
- After a successful conversion, allow the user to run a new conversion using the same inputs without refreshing the page.
- If the user switches between `Video to GIF` and `Images to GIF`, reset the irrelevant inputs and preview.
- Provide subtle text labels under file inputs:
  - For video: “Recommended: short clips under 15 seconds.”
  - For images: “Tip: upload 3–20 images for best results.”

---

### Implementation Notes

- Use `script.js` to:
  - Handle file inputs, previews, settings, and calling the GIF conversion library.
  - Update progress UI.
  - Create a Blob from the generated GIF and trigger a download with a meaningful filename like `vcm-gif-maker-output.gif`.
- Keep `style.css` organized with sections:
  - Layout
  - Cards
  - Buttons
  - Forms
  - Progress bar
  - Responsive tweaks
- Make the layout responsive:
  - On desktop: preview and settings can appear side-by-side.
  - On mobile: stack vertically (upload → preview → settings → generate → output).

---

### Final Checklist

Before finishing, verify:

- User can:
  - Upload a short video and get a working GIF.
  - Upload multiple images and get a working GIF.
- No network requests are made to upload the media files to any backend (only library loads).
- Error states and progress messages are easy to understand.
- Title, meta tags, H1, FAQ, and VCM Suite CTA are present and match the descriptions above.
- The app looks clean, modern, and usable on both desktop and mobile.

This should result in a polished **VCM GIF Maker** tool suitable for SEO traffic and as a funnel into VCM Suite.
