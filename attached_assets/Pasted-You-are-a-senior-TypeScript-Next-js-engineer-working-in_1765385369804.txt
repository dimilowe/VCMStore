You are a senior TypeScript/Next.js engineer working inside my existing VCM Suite codebase.

CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Postgres CMS already exists (cms_objects, etc.)
- Tools are already stored and rendered via the existing CMS system.
- There is a "Tools" tab and a "Pillars" tab in VCM Admin.
- I do NOT want any database schema changes or migrations for this task.
- I do NOT want any new “cluster engine” logic. Clusters are dead. Pillars replace them.
- The existing field that currently stores a “cluster” identifier on tools must stay, but will now hold a **pillar slug** instead.

GOAL (WHAT I WANT WHEN YOU’RE DONE)

1. In the **VCM Admin → Content → Tools** table:
   - The "Cluster" column and dropdown should become **"Pillar"**.
   - The dropdown options must be populated from my **Pillar pages** (the same items shown in the Pillars tab), NOT from any old cluster presets.
   - Selecting a Pillar stores that Pillar’s slug (or id, if that’s how it’s wired) into the **existing cluster field** for that tool. In code, we are effectively treating `tool.cluster` as `tool.pillarSlug`.

2. On each **Pillar page** (the SEO article/pillar page that the article engine creates):
   - At the bottom (or in a sensible section), show a "Tools in this Pillar" section.
   - That section must list all tools whose `cluster` field equals the current pillar’s slug.
   - Each tool should be rendered as a simple card or link grid that navigates to the tool page.

3. No other behavior should change. Tools continue to render exactly as they do now. Pillars continue to render their content exactly as they do now, just with a new tools section.

---------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 – FIND HOW PILLARS ARE LOADED IN ADMIN
---------------------------------------------------

1. Locate the admin code for the **Pillars** tab in VCM Admin → Content.
   - Find whichever function / hook / helper is used to load the list of pillars for that view.
   - Example names (guessing): `getPillars`, `getAllPillars`, `usePillars`, etc.
   - Use THAT same data source as the canonical “pillar list” for this task. Do NOT invent a new table or type.

2. From that helper you must be able to get, at minimum, for each pillar:
   - `id`
   - `title`
   - `slug` (the URL path or slug used to render the pillar page)

If there is no explicit helper, create a small one that wraps the existing query used by the Pillars tab. It must not change schema, only reuse existing data.

---------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 – REWIRE THE TOOLS TABLE DROPDOWN TO USE PILLARS
---------------------------------------------------

1. Find the component that renders the **Tools** table in VCM Admin.
   - It currently shows columns like Tool, Engine, Cluster, Clouds, Links, Indexed, Actions.
   - There is a dropdown in the “Cluster” column for each tool.

2. Replace the existing “cluster options” source with the **pillar list** from Step 1:
   - Import the helper from Step 1 (e.g. `getAllPillars()`).
   - Load pillars once for the Tools admin view.

3. Change the UI:
   - Column label text: change “Cluster” → **“Pillar”**.
   - Dropdown label/placeholder in the select: `— Pillar —` or `— None —`.

4. Change the dropdown options:
   - Remove any references to old cluster presets / enums / registries.
   - Use the pillar list instead:

   ```tsx
   // PSEUDO-CODE – adapt to actual code
   <select value={tool.cluster ?? ""} onChange={...}>
     <option value="">— None —</option>
     {pillars.map((pillar) => (
       <option key={pillar.id} value={pillar.slug}>
         {pillar.title}
       </option>
     ))}
   </select>
The important point: the value you store in tool.cluster is now pillar.slug. We are not adding a new field; we are repurposing the existing one.
Ensure the save/update logic for a tool:
Still writes to the same field (whatever it’s called in the DB / type, currently representing “cluster”).
No migration; you are just changing what values go in there.
STEP 3 – “TOOLS IN THIS PILLAR” SECTION ON PILLAR PAGES
Locate the route and component that renders a single Pillar page.
This is the page shown for each pillar/article when you click it from the newsletter/blog/pillars section.
It likely lives under something like app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx or similar. Use whatever route actually backs the Pillars tab.
After you resolve the current pillar from params:
Get its slug (the one used for URLs).
Query the CMS for tools that belong to this pillar by matching the cluster field to the pillar slug:
// PSEUDO – adapt to your ORM / helper
const toolsInPillar = await db.cms_objects.findMany({
  where: {
    type: "tool",
    cluster: pillar.slug, // cluster now represents pillarSlug
  },
  select: {
    slug: true,
    title: true,
    // pull any other fields you want for display
  },
});
Render a section ONLY if there are tools:
{toolsInPillar.length > 0 && (
  <section className="mt-12 border-t pt-8">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">
      Tools in this pillar
    </h2>
    <div className="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
      {toolsInPillar.map((tool) => (
        <Link key={tool.slug} href={tool.slug}>
          <div className="rounded-xl border p-4 hover:shadow-sm">
            <div className="font-medium">{tool.title}</div>
            {/* Optionally show a short description if available */}
          </div>
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  </section>
)}
Use the existing design system (cards, typography, spacing) so it fits the rest of the page.
Do NOT introduce Tailwind classes that conflict with the current layout; keep it consistent.
Do not touch how the rest of the pillar content is rendered. You’re only appending a tools section at the bottom (or near-bottom).
STEP 4 – CLEAN-UP / LABELS
In any UI where the word “Cluster” is currently shown in the Tools context, change the label to “Pillar”.
This includes:
Table headers in the Tools admin screen
Filters/dropdowns that list “All Clusters” → should become “All Pillars” and use the pillar list.
Do NOT rename the DB column or types. Only rename user-facing labels and swap the data source under the dropdowns/filters.
STEP 5 – VERIFY
In VCM Admin → Content → Pillars:
Create 2–3 pillar pages if none exist yet (via the article engine, as usual).
In VCM Admin → Content → Tools:
Confirm the column is now labeled “Pillar”.
Open the dropdown for a tool; you should see your Pillar titles, not old cluster names.
Assign different pillars to a few tools and save.
Reload the page and confirm the selected pillar persists per tool (stored in the cluster field internally).
Visit a Pillar page in the frontend:
Confirm that the “Tools in this Pillar” section appears.
Confirm that it lists the tools you just assigned to that pillar.
Click those tool links and confirm they navigate correctly.
Visit a Pillar with no tools assigned:
Confirm that no empty tools section is rendered.
Do not change anything else. The only changes in this task are:
Cluster dropdown → driven by Pillars and relabeled as Pillar.
Cluster field on tools now treated as pillarSlug.
Pillar pages render a “Tools in this Pillar” section based on that mapping.
Implement all of the above, then show the final code changes file-by-file.
