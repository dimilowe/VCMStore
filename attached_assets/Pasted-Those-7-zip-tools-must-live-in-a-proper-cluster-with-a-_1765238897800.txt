Those 7 zip tools must live in a proper cluster with a pillar, not just be thrown into CLUSTER_REGISTRY halfway.
Here’s how I’d structure it and what to tell Replit.
1. Concept: one dedicated zip cluster
Create a single cluster, something like:
Cluster key: zip-file-tools
Pillar page: /pillars/zip-file-tools (or /answers/zip-file-tools if your other clusters use answers)
Tools: the 7 CMS zip tools (whatever their slugs are)
articleSlugs: empty array for now, to be filled later
That gives you:
Sibling links between all 7 zip tools
A pillar link from each tool
Room to later add 1–3 support articles for stronger expected link counts
2. Example CLUSTER_REGISTRY entry
Adapt this to your actual slugs + pillar path and match whatever shape clusterRegistry.ts uses:
// data/clusterRegistry.ts

export const CLUSTER_REGISTRY: ClusterRegistry = {
  // ...existing clusters...

  "zip-file-tools": {
    label: "Zip File Tools",
    pillarSlug: "/pillars/zip-file-tools", // or /answers/zip-file-tools
    toolSlugs: [
      "zip-file-creator",
      "image-zipper",
      "folder-zipper",
      "pdf-zipper",
      "multi-file-zipper",
      "zip-extractor",
      "zip-compressor",
    ],
    articleSlugs: [
      // fill in later, e.g.:
      // "/answers/how-to-compress-files-online",
      // "/answers/zip-vs-rar-vs-7z",
    ],
  },
};
(Replace the tool slugs with your real 7; point pillarSlug at whatever route you’ll use.)
3. Message you can send back
I can see that the 7 zip-file tools are CMS-structured but not part of any topic cluster yet. I want these treated as a full cluster with a pillar page, not just floating tools.
I’ll add a zip-file-tools cluster to clusterRegistry with:
pillarSlug: /pillars/zip-file-tools (or whatever pillar path we standardize on)
toolSlugs: all 7 CMS zip tools
articleSlugs: an empty array for now that we can populate with support articles later
Once that’s in place, the expected-links logic (siblings + min(articles, 3) + pillar) will apply correctly to all zip tools, and they’ll be fully wired into the cluster architecture.
That gives them a clear, correct cluster with pillar + future article hooks, and it keeps your expected-link counts honest.
