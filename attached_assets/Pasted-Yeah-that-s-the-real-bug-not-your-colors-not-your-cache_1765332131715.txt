Yeah, that’s the real bug – not your colors, not your cache.
.text-gradient is almost always implemented as:
.text-gradient {
  background-image: linear-gradient(...);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}
If that leaks onto any parent, every nested heading looks washed-out/pink, exactly like your screenshot.
The fix is scope it, not hack individual headings.
What “scoped CSS reset” should actually mean
You want one of these two patterns (pick one and tell Replit to do it this way):
Option A – Restrict gradient to marketing sections only ✅ (cleanest)
Change your CSS from:
.text-gradient {
  /* gradient styles here */
}
to something like:
.marketing-hero .text-gradient,
.marketing-section .text-gradient {
  background-image: linear-gradient(...);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}
So:
Marketing heroes still get gradient text.
Tool pages (Price Engine, other engines) never inherit the gradient unless they explicitly use .text-gradient.
This is the right long-term fix.
Option B – Reset inside tool pages
If you already have a wrapper for tool pages (e.g. .tool-page, .creator-tool-shell, etc.), add:
.tool-page .text-gradient,
.tool-page [data-tool-root='true'] {
  background-image: none !important;
  -webkit-background-clip: border-box !important;
  color: inherit !important; /* then use text-zinc-900 / 700 via Tailwind */
}
You’re basically saying: “inside tool pages, kill any leftover gradient effects.”
What you should NOT let them do
Don’t let them throw random inline styles on headings again.
Don’t let them add some generic * { background-image: none } nuke.
Don’t rely on “webview DOM wrappers” as an excuse. The real issue is the gradient class being too global.
If you want a one-liner to send back:
Keep .text-gradient but scope it to .marketing-hero / marketing layouts only, or add a .tool-page wrapper reset so engine headings can never inherit the gradient. No inline hex hacks, just fix the selector scope.
Once that’s in, the Price page should finally look normal everywhere.
