Got it — this is a UI styling issue, not data or layout.
Your orange card is visible because it has a solid background.
The cards on the left and right are “invisible” because:
✅ 1. Their background is set to transparent or bg-gradient-to-* but your new white dashboard background washes them out.
In the new Adobe-white cloud style, any card that uses:
transparent backgrounds
soft gradients with low contrast
or white-to-transparent fades
…will appear totally invisible against a pure white page.
✅ 2. The shadow is probably too faint or missing
Your Tailwind tokens (shadow-sm, shadow-md, etc.) may not be rendering strongly, making them blend into the white.
⚠️ 3. The CSS dump you sent confirms this
You have this pattern:
--card: 0 0% 100%;
--card-foreground: 240 10% 3.9%;
That means your card background defaults to pure white.
Combine that with a white page → invisible cards.

✔️ FIX: You want solid white cards with visible shadows and NO gradient overlays
This is the correct Tailwind card style for your new UI:
<div className="rounded-xl bg-white shadow-[0_2px_10px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)] border border-zinc-100 p-4">
  {/* card content */}
</div>
Or if using shadcn Card:
<Card className="bg-white border border-zinc-200 shadow-sm">
  <CardContent>
    ...
  </CardContent>
</Card>
The important parts:
bg-white
border-zinc-100 or 200
shadow-sm or custom subtle shadow
NO gradient background
NO transparent overlay
✔️ FIX: Remove gradients from the card components
Find where Replit added something like:
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-400/20 to-transparent"
or:
style={{ background: "linear-gradient(...)" }}
Remove it entirely.
✔️ FIX: Ensure inactive cards still have a visible wrapper
Some clouds use “ghost cards” for empty states or locked tools.
These were coded like this:
<div className="rounded-xl p-4 bg-gradient-to-br from-transparent to-transparent">
On your new layout → invisible.
Replace with:

<div className="rounded-xl p-4 bg-white border border-zinc-200 shadow-sm">
✔️ FIX: Your screenshot shows the cards exist — they’re just blending into the pure white background.
See these faint edges?
The card still renders
It’s just white on white
Exactly what happens when a designer switches to a white-first dashboard but leaves cards transparent.
✔️ EXACT FIX I RECOMMEND YOU TELL REPLIT TO APPLY:
Universal Tool Card Style
Apply globally to ALL tool cards:
className="bg-white border border-zinc-200 shadow-sm rounded-xl overflow-hidden"
Remove all gradient classes
Search for these patterns and delete them:
bg-gradient-to-

to-
