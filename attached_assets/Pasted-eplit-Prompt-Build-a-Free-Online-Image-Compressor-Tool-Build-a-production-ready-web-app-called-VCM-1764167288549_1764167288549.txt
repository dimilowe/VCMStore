eplit Prompt: Build a Free Online Image Compressor Tool
Build a production-ready web app called “VCM Image Compressor” that runs on Replit. This is a single-purpose tool: compress image files (JPG, PNG, WebP) online with no watermark or sign-up. It must be fast, clean, and SEO-optimized to rank for the keyword “image compressor” and related terms (“compress image”, “compress jpg”, “compress png”).
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js + Express
Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no React)
Image processing: Sharp (preferred) or Jimp
File upload: multer
View engine: EJS or plain HTML templates (keep it simple)
Core Routes
GET /tools/image-compressor
Renders the main landing page and tool UI.
SEO:
<title>: Image Compressor – Free Online Image Compression (JPG/PNG/WebP)
<meta name="description">:
Compress images online for free. Reduce JPG, PNG, and WebP file size instantly with no watermark or sign-up. Fast image compressor for web, social, and uploads.
H1: Free Image Compressor (Reduce JPG/PNG Size Online)
Subheading: one sentence explaining the tool:
“Upload an image and instantly reduce its file size without losing visible quality.”
UI elements above the fold:
Drag-and-drop upload area that also supports click-to-browse
Accepted formats: JPG/JPEG, PNG, WebP
Max file size text: Maximum file size: 10MB
Compression level selector (3 options):
Light (Best quality)
Balanced (Recommended)
Maximum (Smallest file)
Primary button: Compress Image
A section below the tool for displaying:
Original file size
Compressed file size
Percentage reduction
Download button for the compressed image
POST /tools/image-compressor
Uses multer to handle a single file upload (image field).
Validations:
Reject missing file
Reject non-image MIME types (only jpg/jpeg, png, webp)
Max file size: 10MB (use multer limits + custom error)
Compression logic using Sharp:
Read the file.
Based on compression level:
Light: mild quality reduction (e.g. JPEG quality ~80, PNG/WebP moderate compression)
Balanced: stronger compression (e.g. JPEG quality ~65)
Maximum: aggressive compression (e.g. JPEG quality ~45, convert PNG → JPEG if it makes sense)
For PNG/WebP, use appropriate Sharp options to reduce size.
Save compressed image to a temp folder.
Return a rendered result view (or same template with injected data) showing:
Original size in KB/MB
Compressed size
% reduction
A “Download compressed image” button that hits a download route.
On error, re-render the page with a clear, user-friendly error message.
GET /tools/image-compressor/download/:id
Serves the compressed image as an attachment.
After sending file, delete both original and compressed temp files for that ID.
Rate Limiting & Limits
Implement a simple in-memory rate limiter per IP:
e.g. max 20 compressions per hour.
If exceeded, show:
“You’ve hit the hourly limit for free compressions. Please try again later.”
Enforce 10MB max upload size on the server.
Only keep temp files for a short time; clean up right after download.
Frontend / UX Requirements
Overall layout:
Centered container, max width ~720px.
Light background, black text, subtle shadows, rounded card around the tool.
Responsive and mobile-friendly.
Components:
Drag-and-drop area with dashed border and an upload icon.
Compression level selector as 3 side-by-side buttons or cards with labels:
Title (Light / Balanced / Maximum)
Subtitle (Best quality / Recommended / Smallest file)
Balanced pre-selected.
Primary CTA button in a contrasting color (e.g. yellow/gold).
After compression:
Show a results card:
Original size: X.Y MB
Compressed size: Z.KB
Reduced by: N%
Download button: Download Compressed Image
Under the results, include a small note:
“Need an even smaller file? Try running Maximum compression or resizing the image before upload.”
APE Funnel CTA
Somewhere below the tool (but above the SEO text), add a dark band section:
Title: “Turn Your Images Into Money”
Text:
Use APE (Auto Paywall Everything) to gate your best images behind tips, subscriptions, or one-time unlocks.
Button: Learn About APE → link to /products/ape (create a simple placeholder page if needed).
SEO Content Section (Below the Tool)
After the CTA, add a ~400–600 word SEO block with headings:
What is an Image Compressor?
Short explanation of image compression.
Why Compress an Image?
Faster loading, better SEO, easier sharing, storage savings, email/platform limits, etc.
