You are an expert full-stack dev building a small, SEO-optimized micro-site around the keyword “calorie counter walking”.

Goal:
Build a **Calorie Counter Walking** mini-site with:
- A walking calories calculator on the homepage.
- Long-form SEO content on that same page.
- 2 supporting articles to build topical depth.
- Built so I can deploy it easily on Replit as a Node/Express app serving static HTML/CSS/JS.

Tech stack:
- Node.js + Express
- Static frontend in `public/` (plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JS only)
- No React, no bundlers, no heavy dependencies.

Project structure:
- `index.js` → Express server
- `public/`
  - `index.html` → main walking calculator page
  - `article-steps-vs-calories.html` → supporting article #1
  - `article-walking-for-fat-loss.html` → supporting article #2
  - `styles.css`
  - `app.js`
- Everything must be complete and runnable.

Server requirements:
- Use Express.
- Serve `public` as static.
- `/` → `index.html`
- `/steps-vs-calories-walking` → `article-steps-vs-calories.html`
- `/walking-for-fat-loss` → `article-walking-for-fat-loss.html`
- Listen on `process.env.PORT || 3000`.
- Add a brief comment at top of `index.js` explaining how to run (`npm install`, `npm start`).

### Core Feature: Walking Calories Calculator (on index.html)

Place this **above the fold**.

Inputs:
- Weight (number, with kg/lb toggle; store internally as kg)
- Walking duration (minutes)
- Walking speed / intensity dropdown:
  - Easy walk (~3 km/h)
  - Normal walk (~4–5 km/h)
  - Brisk walk (~5.5–6.5 km/h)
  - Power walk (~7 km/h)

Logic (implement in `app.js`):
- Use MET values internally and compute calories:
  - Easy walk: MET ≈ 2.5
  - Normal walk: MET ≈ 3.3
  - Brisk walk: MET ≈ 4.3
  - Power walk: MET ≈ 5.0
- Formula:
  - `Calories = MET × 3.5 × weight_kg / 200 × minutes`
- Also estimate distance walked in km and miles using speed and time.
- If weight is empty, default to 70 kg.
- Validate:
  - Minutes > 0, < 600.
  - Weight > 0, < 300 kg.
- If invalid, show inline error text next to the field.

Outputs (in a result card):
- “Estimated calories burned walking: XXX kcal”
- “Estimated distance: X.X km (Y.Y miles)”
- “Estimated pace: S km/h”
- Disclaimer: “These are rough estimates, not medical advice.”

UX:
- When user clicks “Calculate”, scroll smoothly to the results card if it’s below the fold.
- Add a “Reset” small link to clear all fields and results.
- Use a clean, modern card layout for the calculator and results.

### Design / Layout
