✅ THE ACTUAL REPLIT PROMPT (PASTE THIS DIRECTLY INTO REPLIT CHAT)
Replit — please add two new clouds to the VCM Cloud system. They must be named:
Shopping Cloud
slug/id = shopping
Advertising Cloud
slug/id = advertising
Follow the existing architecture exactly.
Do not remove or rewrite anything — only extend.
1. Update the CloudId type
Find the file where CloudId is defined (usually lib/constants/clouds.ts or similar) and add:
| 'shopping'
| 'advertising'
to the existing CloudId union.
2. Add both clouds to CLOUD_REGISTRY
In the same file, extend the CLOUD_REGISTRY with:
shopping: {
  id: 'shopping',
  name: 'Shopping Cloud',
  slug: 'shopping',
  description:
    'Tools for outfits, styling, shopping boards, lookbooks, product mixing, and shoppable content.',
  icon: 'shirt',
  color: 'from-pink-500 to-rose-500',
  order: 9,
},
advertising: {
  id: 'advertising',
  name: 'Advertising Cloud',
  slug: 'advertising',
  description:
    'Tools for paid reach, ads, campaign testing, funnels, optimizations, and marketing workflows.',
  icon: 'megaphone',
  color: 'from-sky-500 to-indigo-500',
  order: 10,
},
Ensure both are added to any CLOUD_LIST or exported array used for dropdowns.
3. Add DB upserts in the cloud seed script
Find the cloud seeding file (often prisma/seed.ts, db/seeds/clouds.ts, or similar).
Add two upserts:
await db.cloud.upsert({
  where: { slug: 'shopping' },
  update: {
    name: 'Shopping Cloud',
    description:
      'Tools for outfits, styling, shopping boards, lookbooks, product mixing, and shoppable content.',
  },
  create: {
    slug: 'shopping',
    name: 'Shopping Cloud',
    description:
      'Tools for outfits, styling, shopping boards, lookbooks, product mixing, and shoppable content.',
  },
});

await db.cloud.upsert({
  where: { slug: 'advertising' },
  update: {
    name: 'Advertising Cloud',
    description:
      'Tools for paid reach, ads, campaign testing, funnels, optimizations, and marketing workflows.',
  },
  create: {
    slug: 'advertising',
    name: 'Advertising Cloud',
    description:
      'Tools for paid reach, ads, campaign testing, funnels, optimizations, and marketing workflows.',
  },
});
Run the cloud seeder after modifying.
4. Update CMS Cloud Dropdown UI
Search for any UI component that renders a Cloud selection dropdown (e.g., admin tool editor).
Make sure the dropdown pulls from CLOUD_REGISTRY OR add:
{ value: 'shopping', label: 'Shopping Cloud' }
{ value: 'advertising', label: 'Advertising Cloud' }
5. Add new cloud dashboards
Create the pages:
/clouds/shopping
/clouds/advertising
Each should use your existing CloudDashboard component:
export default function Page() {
  return <CloudDashboard cloudId="shopping" />;
}
and
export default function Page() {
  return <CloudDashboard cloudId="advertising" />;
}
6. Assign tools to these clouds
Update CMS objects so:
Outfit Generator → "cloud": "shopping"
ClipFits → "cloud": "shopping"
YouTube Title Tester → "cloud": "advertising"
Any A/B testing tools → "cloud": "advertising"
Ad Overlay / Toast integrations → "cloud": "advertising" when ready
Important Requirements for Replit
Do NOT modify pricing or subscriptions yet
Do NOT alter existing clouds
Do NOT rename or delete any existing cloud
These clouds must show up everywhere the others do: dashboards, CMS, tool metadata, dropdowns, API endpoints
