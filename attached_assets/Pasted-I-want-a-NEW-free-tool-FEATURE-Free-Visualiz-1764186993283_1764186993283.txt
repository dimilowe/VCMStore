I want a NEW free tool:

====================================================
FEATURE: Free Visualization Tool (Text-to-Diagram Generator)
Route: /tools/visualization
====================================================

HIGH-LEVEL IDEA
----------------
A simple “free visualization tool” where users:
- Paste structured text
- Click a button
- Instantly see a diagram rendered from that text

Examples:
1) Flow / funnel
Landing Page
  > Lead Magnet
      > Email Sequence
  > Sales Page

2) Process
Idea
  > Research
  > Prototype
      > Feedback
  > Launch

The tool:
- Parses indentation and arrow symbols (">") to determine hierarchy
- Creates a node for each line
- Draws arrows from parent to child
- Auto-arranges nodes using a simple layout (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
- Runs ENTIRELY in the browser (no backend, no paid APIs)

Use a lightweight diagram lib such as **React Flow** or **Dagre + d3**, or even a simple custom SVG layout if easier.
Key requirement: no expensive external/AI APIs.

====================================================
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
====================================================

ROUTE & PAGE
-------------
Create page at:
- `app/tools/visualization/page.tsx`

The page must:
- Use the existing global layout; do NOT manually re-add the Navbar.
- Match the visual style of other tools (centered, card UI).

LAYOUT SECTIONS
----------------

1) HERO
- H1: “Free Visualization Tool”
- Subheading: “Turn simple text into clean diagrams. Perfect for funnels, workflows, and content systems.”
- Small note: “Runs fully in your browser. No signup, no data stored.”

2) INPUT PANEL (LEFT, ON DESKTOP)
A card with:
- Label: “Enter your structure as text”
- A resizable <textarea> with:
  - min rows: 10
  - monospace font
  - placeholder showing a complete example:

Example placeholder:

Landing Page
  > Lead Magnet
      > Email Sequence
  > Sales Page
Social Media Post
  > Short-Form Video
      > QR Code to Funnel
          > APE Paywall

- Under the textarea, a short “Syntax help” section:
  - “Each line becomes a node.”
  - “Indentation (spaces) creates hierarchy.”
  - “Use ‘>’ to indicate a child step (optional).”

Buttons:
- Primary: “Generate Diagram”
- Secondary: “Use Example” (fills textarea with the placeholder example).

3) DIAGRAM PANEL (RIGHT, ON DESKTOP)
A card that contains the rendered diagram.

Behavior:
- On first load, show a subtle empty state message: “Your diagram will appear here.”
- After clicking “Generate Diagram”, parse the text and update the diagram.
- Diagram should:
  - Scroll/zoom if needed
  - Show nodes as rounded rectangles with:
    - Node label = trimmed line text (without leading > and extra spaces)
  - Draw edges from parent to child
  - Use automatic layout:
    - Either left-to-right (root on left, children to the right) OR
    - Top-to-bottom (root at top, children below)

Use either:
- React Flow (preferred for speed in Next/React) OR
- A simple internal layout algorithm creating a flexbox grid or absolutely positioned nodes.

4) EXPORT / UTILITIES
- A small toolbar above the diagram:
  - “Center Diagram” button (resets pan/zoom or scroll)
  - “Download PNG” button if using React Flow or canvas/SVG export is straightforward. If not trivial, skip PNG and just implement a “Screenshot tip” text:
    - “Tip: Use your browser’s screenshot tool to save this diagram.”

====================================================
PARSING LOGIC
====================================================

You must implement a function that converts the textarea text into nodes + edges.

Pseudo-rules:

- Split input by newlines.
- Ignore empty lines.
- For each line:
  - Count leading spaces (or tabs). Each 2 spaces = 1 depth level. (You can decide the exact mapping, just be consistent).
  - Remove leading `>` characters and extra spaces from the label.
  - The depth level determines the parent-child relationship.

Algorithm idea:

- Maintain a stack array where index = depth, value = node id of the latest node at that depth.
- For each parsed line:
  - create a node with unique id (string, e.g. "node-1", "node-2")
  - if depth > 0 and stack[depth-1] exists:
      - create edge from stack[depth-1] → current node
  - update stack[depth] = current node id
  - clear any deeper stack entries (depth+1, depth+2, etc.)

Node shape type (TS):

```ts
type DiagramNode = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  depth: number;
};
type DiagramEdge = {
  id: string;
  source: string;
  target: string;
};
Store these in React state for rendering in React Flow (or your diagram lib).
====================================================
FRONTEND UX DETAILS
Use React hooks (useState, useMemo) inside the Next.js page client component.
Mark the page as a client component at the top: "use client";
Show:
Loading state when “Generate Diagram” is clicked (briefly, while parsing/rendering).
Error message if the parsed result has 0 nodes: “We couldn’t detect any lines. Try using the example format.”
Make desktop layout a 2-column grid:
Left: input (approx 40%)
Right: diagram (approx 60%)
On mobile:
Stack vertically: input on top, diagram below.
====================================================
SEO & COPY
Add Next.js metadata export for this page:
Title: “Free Visualization Tool – Text to Diagram | VCM Store”
Description: “Turn simple text into diagrams for funnels, workflows, and content systems. Free online visualization tool that runs in your browser.”
Below the main tool, add SEO-friendly text content (simple, I will refine later):
Section 1:

H2: “What Is This Free Visualization Tool?”
2–3 paragraphs explaining:
It turns structured text into basic diagrams.
You can use it for funnels, workflows, systems, etc.
No signup, no data stored.
Section 2:
H2: “How to Format Your Text for Diagrams”
Short bullet list:
Each line is a node.
Indent children using spaces.
Optional “>” arrow to show a step.
Section 3:
H2: “Use Your Diagrams With VCM OS”
Bullet points about:
Turning diagrams into landing pages.
Mapping out content funnels for APE.
Using QR Social to connect offline/short-form content into the funnel.
Planning creator offers and monetization flows.
====================================================
NAV / RESOURCES MENU
In whatever component controls the “RESOURCES → FREEBIES” dropdown (where GIF Compressor, Image Compressor, Word Counter, Logo Generator, etc., already appear):
Add a new item:
Label: “Visualization Tool”
Subtext: “Turn text into diagrams”
Href: /tools/visualization
Match the styling and hover behavior of existing entries.

====================================================
CODE QUALITY
Use TypeScript throughout.
Encapsulate parsing logic into a separate utility function file if convenient, e.g. lib/diagramParser.ts.
No external paid APIs.
No server-side work is required; this can be entirely client-side.
Keep components small and readable.
Once implemented:
Ensure the page builds and runs locally.
Test with the example text to confirm nodes and edges render as expected.
Confirm that mobile view is usable (textarea not tiny, diagram scrollable).
