✅ **THE SEO STRUCTURE YOU NEED
(so this page becomes a traffic engine)**
This is the exact on-page structure that lets HubSpot win, Jasper win, and Ubersuggest win.
We’ll turn your single tool page into a full SEO Landing Page + Tool + Education Hub.
Google LOVES when a tool page looks like a resource page.
This is what we add:
🔥 SECTION 1 — Keyword-Rich Intro (200–300 words)
Under the hero section, but BEFORE the tool itself.

Keywords to include:

Do NOT keyword-stuff.
Blend them naturally.

🔥 SECTION 10 — Add 800–1200 additional words of supportive content
You need a minimum 1,800–2,200 words total on the page for REAL SEO power.
Right now you have maybe 50 words.
That’s why it won’t rank.
🎯 THE RULE:
Your tool is the bait.
Your long-form content is the ranking engine.
