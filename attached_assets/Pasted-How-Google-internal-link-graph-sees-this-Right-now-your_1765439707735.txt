How Google / internal link graph sees this
Right now your new setup means every pillar will have:
Inbound links from /tools (Collections grid)
/tools → /tools/zip-file-tools
This alone means it’s no longer an orphan.
Inbound links from every attached tool (breadcrumbs)
/tools/zip-password-remover → /tools/zip-file-tools
/tools/online-zip-compressor → /tools/zip-file-tools
Each tool becomes an extra “vote” for the pillar.
Outbound links from the pillar to its tools (hub behavior)
/tools/zip-file-tools → list of tools.
That’s the classic “hub page” SEO pattern.
Cross-links between pillars (Related Collections)
/tools/zip-file-tools → /tools/pdf-tools, /tools/file-security-tools, etc.
Now pillars form a subgraph, not isolated islands.
Put together:
A pillar now has multiple strong inbound links, robust outbound links, and graph connections to siblings.
That’s the exact opposite of an orphan.
So yes — your step 1–4 plan is correct and sufficient to solve pillar orphaning.
A couple of surgical upgrades (not required, but smart)
If you want to do it properly, do this too:
Filter only “indexable” pillars in queries
WHERE type='pillar' AND is_indexed = true (or whatever your flag is)
Keeps draft/test pillars out of /tools and “Related Collections”.
Order related pillars by relevance, not random
Even a cheap version is fine:
Same cluster first → then everything else
Or: manually set a priority or cluster_slug in the CMS and sort by that
Make breadcrumbs consistent everywhere
Tools under pillars always show:
Tools > [Pillar Title] > [Tool Name]
Tools without a pillar:
Tools > [Tool Name]
Don’t half-implement; either your breadcrumbs are a rule, or they’re noise.
Make sure your URL registry knows about pillars
Every pillar slug should exist in global_urls (or equivalent)
Mark them as type='pillar', not tool
That way your URL registry, sitemap, and any future nav logic can treat them correctly.
Bottom line
“good for fixing pillar page orphaning?”
Yes. This isn’t just “good,” this is the correct fix:
/tools → pillars
tools → pillar (breadcrumbs)
pillar → tools
pillar → related pillars
Once all four are live, a pillar page would only be “orphaned” if you deliberately hide it everywhere and turn indexing off.
