One “Featured” toggle per tool in Content Manager → drives both:
Free Creator Tools homepage section
Resources ▸ Creator Tools dropdown
Here’s how I’d wire it, step-by-step, without overcomplicating anything.
1. Add a featured flag to your CMS objects
In your DB (where cms_objects / tools live), add a boolean:
ALTER TABLE cms_objects
ADD COLUMN featured boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
If you’re on Prisma, that’s:
// schema.prisma
model CmsObject {
  id        String  @id @default(cuid())
  slug      String  @unique
  kind      String
  title     String
  // ...other fields...

  featured  Boolean @default(false)   // <— NEW
}
Run the migration.
2. Expose featured in the admin API
Wherever you fetch tools for the Content Manager (something like /api/admin/tools):
// Example
const tools = await db.cmsObject.findMany({
  where: { kind: "tool" },
  select: {
    id: true,
    slug: true,
    title: true,
    engine: true,
    pillar: true,
    clouds: true,
    indexed: true,
    featured: true, // <— add this
  },
});
And add a simple update endpoint:
// POST /api/admin/tools/feature
// body: { id: string, featured: boolean }

await db.cmsObject.update({
  where: { id },
  data: { featured },
});
Nothing fancy.
3. Add a “Featured” toggle column in Content Manager
On the page in your first screenshot (Tool / Engine / Pillar / Clouds / Links / Indexed / Actions):
Add a header:
<th>Featured</th>
For each row, render a toggle bound to tool.featured:
<td>
  <Switch
    checked={tool.featured}
    onCheckedChange={(value) => {
      void updateFeatured(tool.id, value);
    }}
  />
</td>
Where updateFeatured calls the admin API:
async function updateFeatured(id: string, featured: boolean) {
  await fetch("/api/admin/tools/feature", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ id, featured }),
  });
}
Now you have ONE toggle that marks a tool as featured.
4. Drive both UI surfaces from that same flag
a) Free Creator Tools homepage section
Where you currently build this grid:
const tools = await db.cmsObject.findMany({
  where: {
    kind: "tool",
    featured: true,           // <— only featured
    // optionally: indexed: true
  },
  orderBy: { title: "asc" },  // or manual order later
});
Render from that instead of a hard-coded list.
b) Resources ▸ Creator Tools dropdown
Same idea. Wherever you build that dropdown list:
const featuredTools = await db.cmsObject.findMany({
  where: {
    kind: "tool",
    featured: true,
  },
  orderBy: { title: "asc" },
});
If you’re grouping them by category (AI Tools, SEO & Marketing, etc.), you just filter by both featured: true and category: "ai-tools" etc.
5. Behavior summary
After this:
You go to VCM Admin → Content
Flip a single “Featured” toggle for a tool
That tool instantly appears or disappears from:
Free Creator Tools homepage grid
Resources ▸ Creator Tools dropdown
No more manually editing two separate configs.
