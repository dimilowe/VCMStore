REPLIT PROMPT: Free Word Counter Tool (VCM OS SEO Tool)
You are building a single-page “Free Word Counter Tool” web app designed to rank for keywords like “counting words tool”, “word counter tool online”, “free word counter” and to funnel traffic into the VCM OS / APE ecosystem.
🔧 Tech Stack
Node.js + Express (simple server to serve a static page)
Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling (no build tools)
No database, no auth, no external APIs
The goal is: fast, lightweight, no-login, ad-free utility with great UX + strong on-page SEO.
1. Project Structure
Create a project with:
index.js – Express server
public/
index.html
style.css (optional, for small overrides; most styling via Tailwind)
app.js
index.js:
Basic Express setup
Serves public/index.html on /
Serves static assets from public
Listens on process.env.PORT || 3000
2. Page Content & Layout (index.html)
Use a clean, centered layout similar to modern SaaS tools.
Global
<title>Free Word Counter Tool – Online Word & Character Counter</title>
Meta description:
"Free online word counter tool. Instantly count words, characters, sentences, paragraphs, and reading time. No ads, no sign-up, completely free."
Open Graph tags (basic): title, description, URL placeholder, image placeholder.
Use Tailwind via CDN in <head>.
Layout Sections (top to bottom)
Header / Hero
H1: Free Word Counter Tool
Subheading: short line like
“Paste your text and instantly see word count, character count, reading time, and more. No ads, no sign-up.”
Centered, with generous padding and max-width container.
Main Tool Card
A white card with subtle shadow, rounded corners, max-width ~900px, centered.
Inside the card:
A. Input Area
Label: “Paste or type your text below”
Large <textarea> with:
Full width
Min height ~220px
Rounded, border, focus ring
Placeholder: “Start typing or paste your text here…”
Under textarea: two buttons:
“Clear Text”
“Copy Text”
Both styled with Tailwind (primary button style similar to your GIF/Image tools – warm yellow / amber is fine).
B. Live Stats Panel
A responsive grid (2–3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile) showing stat cards.
Each stat card: small icon or label, bold number, and label.
Show at least:
Word Count
Character Count (with spaces)
Character Count (without spaces)
Sentence Count
Paragraph Count
Estimated Reading Time (e.g. “1 min 23 sec” assuming 200 wpm)
Reading Level (Flesch–Kincaid or a simplified description like “Easy”, “Medium”, “Difficult” based on score bracket)
All stats update in real time as the user types.
C. Keyword Density (Optional but Recommended)
A small table listing top keywords by frequency:
Columns: “Word”, “Count”, “Percentage”
Show top 10 non-stop-words (ignore extremely common words like “the”, “and”, “of”).
Update when text changes.
APE / VCM OS CTA Block
Below the main tool card, add a dark band CTA similar to your GIF compressor page:
Title: Turn Your Writing Into Money
Copy:
“Use APE (Auto Paywall Everything) to instantly gate your best articles, emails, and guides behind tips, subscriptions, or one-time unlocks.”
Button: “Learn About APE”
Button links to your APE/VCM OS landing page URL (use a dummy # link placeholder if you don’t know it yet).
SEO Content Section
Add a long-form descriptive section under the CTA for SEO, with clear headings and paragraphs. Structure:
H2: What Is a Word Counter Tool?
Explain in simple language what a word counter is and what it’s used for (writers, students, social posts, SEO, emails, etc.).
H2: Why Use an Online Word Counter?
Bullet points:
Stay within assignment or submission limits
Optimize social captions (Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube descriptions)
Improve readability and structure
Track reading time for blog posts or scripts
H2: How to Use This Free Word Counter Tool
Step-by-step bullets:
Paste or type your text into the box above
Watch the stats update instantly
Use reading time + reading level to adjust your copy
Copy or save the final version when you’re done
H2: Understanding the Statistics
Subheadings or bold inline labels explaining:
Word count
Character counts
Sentences and paragraphs
Reading time assumption (e.g. 200 words per minute)
Reading level score and what “Easy / Medium / Difficult” mean
Include internal links in this content where appropriate (just use href="#" placeholders):
Link anchor text like “creator tools”, “QR code generator”, “APE paywall tool” pointing toward your broader ecosystem.
Make the text human-readable, not generic AI fluff. Use a clear, direct tone.
3. Frontend Logic (app.js)
Implement all logic client-side in public/app.js.
On DOMContentLoaded:
Get references to:
textarea
stat elements (word count, characters, sentences, etc.)
Clear / Copy buttons
keyword density table body (if using)
Add input event listener on textarea:
Get current text.
Compute:
Words:
Trim text.
Split on whitespace using regex /\s+/.
Filter out empty strings.
Characters (with spaces): text.length.
Characters (without spaces): text.replace(/\s/g, '').length.
Sentences: split on ., ?, ! using regex and filter empties.
Paragraphs: split on \n and filter out empty/whitespace-only lines.
Reading time: words / 200 → minutes & seconds.
Reading level: can use simple Flesch–Kincaid-style approximation or a fake-simple mapping like:
<= 8th grade → “Easy to read”
9–12 → “Medium”
12 → “More complex”
(Implement a lightweight heuristic; it doesn’t need to be perfect, just consistent.)
Update DOM in real time with the computed stats.
Keyword Density:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation using regex.
Split into words, filter out:
words shorter than 3 chars
common stop-words (build a small array of English stop-words and ignore them).
Count frequencies in an object.
Sort by count descending.
Take top 10.
Render table rows with word, count, and percentage of total meaningful words.
Clear Button:
Clears textarea
Resets all stats to 0 / default.
Copy Button:
Uses navigator.clipboard.writeText(...) with the textarea value.
On success, briefly show small toast (e.g. “Copied!”) in the corner or near the button.
All logic must be efficient and avoid unnecessary reflows.
4. Styling Notes
Use Tailwind utility classes for layout and typography:
Background: light gray (bg-slate-50 or similar)
Main container: max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-10
Card: bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-md p-6 md:p-8
Buttons:
Primary: bg-amber-400 hover:bg-amber-500 text-slate-900 font-semibold rounded-full px-5 py-2 transition
Secondary: neutral outline or subtle background
Stats grid:
grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-6
Each stat card: bg-slate-50 rounded-xl p-4 border border-slate-100
CTA bar:
bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-2xl mt-12 p-6 md:p-8 flex flex-col md:flex-row items-start md:items-center justify-between gap-4
SEO text section:
prose prose-slate max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-12 (include Tailwind Typography plugin CDN if you want prose styling, or just hand-roll basic classes.)
Make sure the page is fully responsive on mobile.
5. Performance & SEO
No heavy frameworks.
No unnecessary animations.
Keep JS bundle minimal.
Use semantic HTML (<main>, <section>, <header>, <footer>).
Include at least one <h1> and several <h2>s with keyword variations:
“word counter tool”
“counting words tool”
“free online word counter”
6. Footer
Add a small footer:
Text like:
“Part of the VCM creator tool stack. Build, monetize, and grow with APE & VCM OS.”
Links (placeholder #):
“APE – Auto Paywall Everything”
“More Free Tools”
“Contact”
Deliverable:
A working Replit project where visiting / shows the Free Word Counter Tool with real-time stats, keyword density, clean UI, strong SEO content, and a CTA funneling users into APE/VCM OS. No auth, no DB, just a fast, polished utility page.
