You are building a full-stack Node.js + Express app with a simple HTML/CSS frontend (no React) that provides an “AI Humanizer Free” tool.
The goal of this app:
Let users paste a blog post or any long-form text.
The backend uses the OpenAI API to:
Estimate the probability that the text was written by AI.
Explain why it sounds AI-like in certain parts.
Suggest improvements.
Optionally “humanize” (rewrite) the entire text to sound more natural and less AI-generated.
The main page must be SEO-optimized for the keyword phrase: “ai humanizer free”.
Stack and Setup
Use Node.js + Express for the backend.
Use plain HTML + CSS (you can use a simple utility-like CSS setup, but no build steps).
Put everything in a single Express project with:
index.js (server)
public/ for static files
views/ for HTML templates (use EJS or plain HTML served via res.sendFile, your choice – EJS is fine).
Use dotenv to load environment variables.
Expect an environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY.
Never expose the API key to the frontend.
Use the OpenAI Node client with a modern text model (e.g., gpt-4.1-mini) to do the analysis and rewriting.
Routes
Implement these routes:
GET /ai-humanizer-free
Serves the main page with the tool UI.
This page is SEO-optimized around the phrase "ai humanizer free".
POST /api/analyze
Accepts JSON: { "text": "..." }.
Validates that text is non-empty and reasonable length (e.g., max ~10,000 characters).
Calls the OpenAI API with a prompt that:
Asks the model to estimate how likely the text is AI-generated (0–100%).
Asks for a short explanation of the score.
Asks for specific sections or patterns that sound AI-like (e.g., overly uniform sentence structure, repetitive phrasing, generic filler).
Asks for an annotated version of the text with markers indicating AI-sounding segments.
The response JSON structure should be:
{
  "aiProbability": 73,
  "summary": "Why this looks AI-like...",
  "reasons": [
    "Sentences have uniform length and structure.",
    "Repetitive phrasing like 'in today's fast-paced world'.",
    "Overuse of generic, vague statements with little specificity."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add concrete examples and personal perspective.",
    "Vary sentence length and rhythm.",
    "Replace generic phrases with specific details about your topic."
  ],
  "annotatedHtml": "<p>...<span class=\"ai-flag\">AI-like sentence</span>...</p>"
}
annotatedHtml should be safe HTML with <span class="ai-flag"> around AI-sounding segments.
POST /api/humanize
Accepts JSON: { "text": "..." }.
Uses the OpenAI API with a prompt like:
“Rewrite this text so it sounds more human, conversational, specific, and less like AI-generated writing. Preserve the original meaning and structure, but reduce generic phrasing and add a more natural voice. Do NOT invent new facts.”
Returns JSON:
{
  "humanizedText": "..."
}
Keep it fast and concise.
OpenAI Integration
In index.js:
Install and import the official OpenAI Node client.
Configure it with process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY.
Wrap calls in try/catch and return proper error responses (status 400 or 500 with JSON messages).
Rate-limit lightly if you want (optional).
The analysis prompt should give the model the text and clearly ask for:
A single integer score 0–100.
A short summary.
A bullet list of reasons.
A bullet list of suggestions.
The annotated version of the text with <span class="ai-flag">...</span> around AI-like segments.
You can have the model respond in JSON and then parse it server-side to avoid brittle string parsing.
Frontend: /ai-humanizer-free Page
Create a single-page layout served at GET /ai-humanizer-free with:
SEO Requirements
In the <head>:
<title>AI Humanizer Free | Make Your AI Writing Sound Human</title>
<meta name="description" content="AI humanizer free tool – paste your blog or article and instantly see how likely it is AI-written, then rewrite it to sound more human and natural.">
<meta name="keywords" content="ai humanizer free, AI writing detector, humanize AI text, AI content detector, make AI writing sound human">
Open Graph tags:
og:title = “AI Humanizer Free – Humanize Your AI Writing”
og:description = similar to meta description
og:type = “website”
Canonical URL set to /ai-humanizer-free.
On the page:
An <h1> that includes the exact phrase “ai humanizer free”, for example:
AI Humanizer Free – Paste Your Blog and Make It Sound Human
An <h2> or intro paragraph that naturally repeats “ai humanizer free” once more, for SEO, but not spammy. Example:
“This ai humanizer free tool helps bloggers, creators, and marketers turn robotic AI drafts into natural, human-sounding writing.”
Add a short FAQ section at the bottom with questions like:
“What is an AI humanizer?”
“How accurate is this AI-written detection?”
“Can I use this to humanize my blog posts for SEO?”
Each answer should be 2–4 sentences and use the phrase “AI humanizer” and “ai humanizer free” naturally.
Layout
Use a simple centered layout with responsive design:
A main container with max-width ~1100px.
Top section:
Title, subtitle, short explanation of what the tool does.
Middle section: a two-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile:
Left column: Input
Label: “Paste your blog or article text”
<textarea id="inputText"> (min-height ~250–300px).
Button: <button id="analyzeBtn">Analyze AI Probability</button>
Button: <button id="humanizeBtn">Humanize My Blog</button>
A small note under the textarea: “We don’t store your text. Analysis happens in memory and is discarded after the request.”
Right column: Results
Section: “AI-Written Probability”
Display a big percentage, like “73% AI-Likely”.
Use a simple progress bar or meter using CSS.
Section: “Why It Looks AI-Written”
Show summary text.
Show reasons as a bullet list.
Section: “Suggested Fixes”
Show suggestions as bullets.
Section: “Highlighted AI-Like Sections”
A scrollable <div id="annotatedOutput"> where you inject annotatedHtml.
CSS: .ai-flag should be a light yellow background, subtle border, maybe italic text.
Below that: Humanized Output
Title: “Humanized Version”
<textarea id="humanizedOutput" readonly> where you show humanizedText from /api/humanize.
A small copy button next to it to copy the content to clipboard.
Frontend JavaScript
In public/script.js:
Listen for clicks on #analyzeBtn:
Grab text from #inputText.
POST to /api/analyze with JSON.
On success:
Update the probability display.
Insert summary, reasons, suggestions.
Set innerHTML of #annotatedOutput to annotatedHtml.
Show loading state while request is in flight.
Handle and display errors cleanly.
Listen for clicks on #humanizeBtn:
Grab text from #inputText.
POST to /api/humanize.
On success:
Put humanizedText into #humanizedOutput.
Show loading state; handle errors.
Implement a “Copy” button next to the humanized output that uses the Clipboard API.
Styling
In public/styles.css:
Use a clean, modern style: white background, light gray panels, simple typography.
Use a single accent for buttons/badges (e.g., a blue or purple).
Style:
.container centered with margin and padding.
.card for input and output panels with subtle shadow and rounded corners.
.ai-flag with light yellow background and subtle border.
.probability-badge larger font size and a circular or pill-shaped badge.
textarea full width with a subtle border and focus outline.
Make sure the layout is mobile-friendly (columns stack vertically on small screens).
Validation and Errors
If user clicks “Analyze” or “Humanize” with empty text:
Show a small inline error under the textarea: “Please paste some text first.”
If server returns an error:
Show a generic message: “Something went wrong during analysis. Please try again.”
Final Check
The main route GET /ai-humanizer-free is the homepage of this tool and is fully SEO-optimized for the keyword “ai humanizer free” in:
title tag
meta description
H1
Intro copy
At least one FAQ answer
Both API routes work end-to-end with the OpenAI API.
The UI feels fast and simple: paste → analyze → humanize.
Build the full project with all files (server, views, CSS, JS), ready to run with node index.js (or npm start).
