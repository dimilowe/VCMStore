Yeah, your instinct is right, but the way you phrase it to Replit matters a lot.
You don’t just want to “change the column name”; you want to standardize the meaning of pillar membership across both tables and make one field the canonical source of truth.
Right now you have:
tools table
pillar_slug → used for pillar membership (legacy tools)
cms_objects table
cluster_slug → currently abused as “pillar membership” for CMS tools
That’s a semantic mess. Fix is:
What you should tell Replit to do
1. Standardize on pillar_slug for pillar membership
Decision:
pillar_slug = “this tool belongs to pillar X”
cluster_slug (if you keep it) = SEO cluster / topical grouping (different concept)
So:
tools.pillar_slug → keep as is
cms_objects.pillar_slug → add + use for pillar membership
cms_objects.cluster_slug → stop using it for pillar membership
2. Migration steps (what they should actually implement)
Ask them to:
Add pillar_slug to cms_objects (if it doesn’t exist yet)
ALTER TABLE cms_objects ADD COLUMN pillar_slug TEXT;
Backfill from current misuse of cluster_slug
For tool-type CMS objects where cluster_slug is currently acting as pillar:
UPDATE cms_objects
SET pillar_slug = cluster_slug
WHERE type = 'tool' AND cluster_slug IS NOT NULL;
Update the admin update API
When you assign a tool to a pillar in Content Manager, it should:
Write pillar_slug in tools
Write pillar_slug in cms_objects (for CMS tools)
Stop writing pillarSlug into cluster_slug anywhere.
Update pillar page queries
In app/tools/[pillar]/page.tsx (or your zip-file-tools page):
// CMS tools
WHERE type = 'tool' AND pillar_slug = $pillarSlug

// Legacy tools
WHERE pillar_slug = $pillarSlug
Remove any cluster_slug = $pillarSlug logic from the pillar membership lookup.
Update any shared helpers / endpoints
/api/pillars/[slug]/tools should:
Query both tables using pillar_slug
getPillarBySlug and any “tools by pillar” helper should use pillar_slug only.
Leave cluster_slug for real cluster use later (optional)
If you still want cluster-level SEO later, keep cluster_slug but stop binding it to pillar membership logic.
Hide it from the pillar assignment UI for now so you don’t confuse things.
Your summary vs what to send
What you wrote:
Change column name for consistency
Update data lookups to use new name
Update admin tools to use new name
Update page data to use new name
Check links still work correctly
Directionally fine, but too vague. They could literally try to rename cluster_slug → pillar_slug and cause chaos.
What you actually want is:
Standardize pillar membership on pillar_slug across both tools and cms_objects.
Add pillar_slug to cms_objects (if missing).
Backfill it from existing cluster_slug where we’ve been using that as pillar.
Admin API should write pillarSlug → tools.pillar_slug and cms_objects.pillar_slug only.
Pillar pages and /api/pillars/[slug]/tools must query by pillar_slug in both tables.
cluster_slug stays available for future cluster logic but is no longer used for pillar membership.
