a full Replit prompt you can paste straight into Replit’s AI to build the “Weather Prediction Tool (Instant Forecast)” without any AI API costs.
You are building a small production-ready web app on Replit called **“Weather Prediction Tool (Instant Forecast)”**.

TECH STACK
- Node.js + Express backend
- Vanilla JS + HTML + CSS frontend (no React)
- Use `fetch` on the frontend to call a single `/api/weather` endpoint
- Use a third-party weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) from the backend only
- Store the API key in a `.env` file as `WEATHER_API_KEY`

GOAL
Create a simple, fast tool where users can:
- Type a city / ZIP / country to get a weather prediction
- OR click “Use my location” (browser geolocation) to auto-detect their coordinates
- See:
  - current temperature
  - “feels like” temperature
  - condition (clear, clouds, rain, etc.)
  - hourly forecast for today (next 12 hours)
  - 7-day prediction (one row per day)
  - chance of rain (if available)
  - wind speed
  - humidity

STRUCTURE
Create the following main files:

- `index.js`         → Express server
- `public/index.html`→ Main UI
- `public/styles.css`→ Basic styling
- `public/app.js`    → Frontend logic
- `.env`             → `WEATHER_API_KEY=...` (dummy value in code, real key the user adds later)
- `package.json`     → With scripts `"start": "node index.js"`

### BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (index.js)

1. Set up an Express app that:
   - Serves static files from `public/`
   - Has a single GET route: `/api/weather`
   - Accepts query parameters:
     - `q` for a text query (city/zip/country)
     - OR `lat` and `lon` for coordinates
   - Validates that either `q` OR (`lat` and `lon`) is provided, otherwise returns 400

2. Integrate with a free weather API (for example OpenWeatherMap “One Call” or equivalent).
   - Use `axios` or `node-fetch`
   - Read `process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY`
   - For city/zip, call the API’s geocoding endpoint if needed to resolve to lat/lon
   - Then call the forecast endpoint for:
     - current conditions
     - hourly forecast (at least 12 hours)
     - daily forecast (7 days)

3. Normalize the response into a clean JSON structure for the frontend, something like:

   ```json
   {
     "location": "Barcelona, Spain",
     "current": {
       "temp": 21,
       "feelsLike": 20,
       "condition": "Clear",
       "icon": "01d",
       "humidity": 60,
       "windSpeed": 3.2,
       "rainChance": 0.0
     },
     "hourly": [
       {
         "time": "2025-12-05T10:00:00Z",
         "temp": 20,
         "condition": "Clouds",
         "icon": "02d",
         "rainChance": 0.1
       },
       ...
     ],
     "daily": [
       {
         "date": "2025-12-05",
         "min": 17,
         "max": 23,
         "condition": "Clear",
         "icon": "01d",
         "rainChance": 0.0
       },
       ...
     ]
   }
On errors (invalid location, API failure, missing key) return a JSON error with status 400 or 500:
{ "error": "Human-readable message" }
Listen on process.env.PORT || 3000.
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (public/index.html)
Design a clean, single-page interface with:
A centered container
Title: “Weather Prediction Tool (Instant Forecast)”
Subtitle explaining: “Type a city or use your location to see today’s weather and a 7-day prediction.”
A search form:
Text input with placeholder: “Enter city or ZIP…”
Button: “Get forecast”
Secondary button: “Use my location”
A result area below the form with these sections:
Current Weather card
Hourly Forecast horizontal scroll or table
7-Day Prediction table or cards
A subtle error message area above the results
A simple footer with small text: “Tool by VCM Suite” (placeholder)
Use semantic HTML (<main>, <section>, <header>, etc.).
FRONTEND LOGIC (public/app.js)
On page load:
Attach event listeners to:
The form submit → call fetchWeatherByQuery()
The “Use my location” button → call navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition and then fetchWeatherByCoords().
fetchWeatherByQuery(query):
Show a loading state (e.g., “Loading forecast…”)
Call /api/weather?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}
On success, call renderWeather(data)
On error, show error message and clear/loading states properly
fetchWeatherByCoords(lat, lon):
Similar to above but calls /api/weather?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}.
renderWeather(data) should:
Fill in:
Location name
Current temp, feels like, condition, icon, humidity, wind, rain chance
Build an hourly forecast section:
Next 12 hours with time + temp + small icon + rain chance
Build a 7-day forecast:
Each day shows:
weekday name
min/max
condition
small icon
Use simple, readable formatting.
Handle errors gracefully (bad location, denied geolocation, API errors) with a red text error bar.
STYLING (public/styles.css)
Keep it clean and modern:
Centered container with max-width ~900px
Light background (#f5f5f5) and white cards
Slight box-shadow and border-radius on cards
Simple typography (system fonts)
Buttons with hover states
Make layout responsive (stack on mobile, grids on desktop)
ENV / CONFIG
Add a .env file (not committed) with:
WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_REAL_KEY_HERE
In the README comment at top of index.js, briefly explain:
How to obtain a free API key from a weather provider
That the user must add it to .env
EXTRA POLISH
Show local time for each hourly entry (not raw UTC).
Format dates as “Mon, Dec 5”.
Add a tiny loading spinner or text under the search bar while fetching.
If no data yet, show a friendly message like “Enter a location to see the weather prediction.”
Make sure the app:
Runs with npm install then npm start
Works end-to-end in the Replit environment
Handles both city query and geolocation usage.
Build all of this now.
