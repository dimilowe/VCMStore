Build a small Node.js + Express web app called Reach Grabber Tool.
This is a single-purpose micro tool that helps users SEO-optimize their blog posts for a target keyword phrase.
The primary SEO keyword for the page is: “reach grabber tool” (exact phrase).

Tech + Structure
	•	Use Node.js + Express.
	•	Serve a single HTML page at route: GET /reach-grabber-tool.
	•	Put static assets in /public.
	•	Use a simple server-rendered HTML template (no React, no heavy framework).
	•	Use vanilla CSS (either inline <style> or a small public/styles.css).
	•	App should run on port 3000.

SEO Requirements (very important)

Optimize the /reach-grabber-tool page explicitly for the keyword phrase “reach grabber tool”:
	1.	HTML <title> tag
	•	<title>Reach Grabber Tool – Free AI SEO Optimizer for Blog Posts</title>
	2.	Meta description
	•	Example:
meta name="description" content="Use the Reach Grabber Tool to instantly optimize your blog posts for SEO. Paste your article, add your target keyword, and let AI rewrite it for better rankings."
	3.	H1 and headings
	•	Main H1: Reach Grabber Tool
	•	Include the phrase “reach grabber tool” in the first paragraph under the H1.
	•	Use H2s for sections like “How the Reach Grabber Tool Works”, “How to Use This SEO Optimizer”, etc., and naturally repeat the phrase a few times without keyword stuffing.
	4.	URL & HTML basics
	•	Route path: /reach-grabber-tool
	•	<html lang="en">
	•	Use proper <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>.
	•	Add a canonical tag with a placeholder URL:
<link rel="canonical" href="https://vcmsuite.com/reach-grabber-tool">
	5.	Content block for internal linking
	•	At the bottom, include a short text section with internal-link placeholders, e.g.:
“Explore more free creator tools in VCM Suite:” followed by three <a> tags with href="#" and descriptive anchor text. I will later update the real URLs.

Page Layout / UX

Hero section:
	•	H1: Reach Grabber Tool
	•	Short 2–3 sentence paragraph explaining that this is an AI-powered SEO optimizer:
	•	Mention: “Paste your blog post, enter your target keyword phrase, and the reach grabber tool will optimize your content for better rankings.”

Form section:
	•	An HTML <form> that does NOT refresh the page (handled via JavaScript fetch).
	•	Inputs:
	1.	Target keyword phrase (text input, label: “Target keyword phrase”)
	•	Placeholder example: reach grabber tool
	2.	Original content (large <textarea> for the blog/article text).
	•	A primary button: “Optimize Content”.
	•	Under the form, show a small note: “This reach grabber tool uses AI to rewrite your content for SEO and readability.”

Result section:
	•	Initially hidden, becomes visible after a successful API response.
	•	Includes:
	•	Subheading: Optimized Article
	•	A <textarea> or <pre> block showing the optimized content.
	•	A Copy to Clipboard button that copies the entire optimized output.
	•	Below that, a small “SEO Snapshot” line with:
	•	Word count of the optimized text.
	•	Number of times the target keyword appears.
	•	Simple density percentage (keyword count / total words * 100, rounded).
	•	This snapshot is calculated in the frontend using JavaScript (no extra API calls).

Loading & error states:
	•	While waiting for the AI response, disable the submit button and show a simple text loader like: “Optimizing your content…”.
	•	On error, show a small red error message near the button.

Backend: AI Call
	•	In server.js (or index.js), create a POST route: POST /api/optimize.
	•	It expects JSON:

{ "keyword": "string", "content": "string" }


	•	Use fetch or axios to call the OpenAI API (Chat Completions).
	•	Read the API key from process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY.
	•	Model: gpt-4.1-mini (or similar).
	•	System prompt: explain that the assistant should act as an expert SEO editor.
	•	User prompt structure (pseudo):
	•	Explain the job: optimize the user’s article so it can rank for the provided keyword phrase.
	•	Rules:
	•	Keep the core meaning and structure.
	•	Improve clarity and flow.
	•	Naturally incorporate the keyword in the title, intro, subheadings where relevant, and conclusion.
	•	Avoid keyword stuffing: no more than ~1–2% keyword density.
	•	Return only the optimized article text, no commentary or markdown, plain paragraphs with headings.
	•	The API route should:
	1.	Validate that keyword and content are non-empty.
	2.	Call OpenAI and get the optimized text.
	3.	Return JSON:

{ "optimizedText": "...the rewritten article..." }

Frontend JavaScript
	•	Attach an event listener to the form’s submit event, prevent default.
	•	Use fetch('/api/optimize', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ keyword, content }) }).
	•	On success, populate the result textarea and show the result section.
	•	Implement a copyOutput() function for the “Copy to Clipboard” button using navigator.clipboard.writeText.

Styling (simple but clean)
	•	Centered layout with max-width ~800px and generous padding.
	•	Use a clean, readable font (e.g. system fonts).
	•	Clear labels, large textarea, responsive on mobile.
	•	Primary button stands out; use hover state.
	•	Make sure text and buttons are accessible (contrast).

Final checklist
	•	App runs with node index.js or node server.js.
	•	Route /reach-grabber-tool serves the SEO-optimized HTML page.
	•	All SEO requirements for the phrase “reach grabber tool” are met:
	•	Title, meta description, H1, intro paragraph, some H2s, body copy.
	•	No download/export feature. Users copy and paste the optimized result.
	•	Code should be clean and commented where necessary so I can tweak prompts and text later.
