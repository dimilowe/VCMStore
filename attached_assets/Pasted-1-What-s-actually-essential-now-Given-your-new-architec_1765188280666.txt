1. What’s actually essential now
Given your new architecture, these are the only core admin jobs:
Content – see/edit all CMS objects (tools, articles, products, clusters), plus import JSON
SEO – control indexing (is_indexed) + see health for each URL
(Optional) Monetization artifacts – Products/Stripe stuff if it’s not yet CMS-based
Everything else is just a filter or a different way of looking at the same data.
2. How to collapse what you have
Based on that Replit summary of existing pages, here’s what I would do.
A. Keep – but MERGE
/admin/content-manager
/admin/cms-import
Merge these into one page called Content in the nav:
Main table:
type, slug, title, cluster, word_count, health, isIndexed (read-only)
actions: “Edit JSON”, “View Live”
Filters:
type (tool/article/product/support)
cluster_slug
health (thin/ok/strong)
isIndexed (yes/no)
Button: “Import JSON” → opens your CMS Import UI as a modal/side panel
Under the hood you can keep /admin/cms-import as a route if you want, but it should not be a separate nav item. It’s just a feature of the Content page now.
Result: ONE Content page does “see everything + import more”.
B. Keep – as SEO
/admin/seo-control
This becomes your single SEO page in nav:
Table from global_urls joined with cms_objects:
url, type, cluster, word_count, health, isIndexed (toggle)
Filters:
type
cluster
Ready to Index = health in [ok, strong] AND isIndexed=false
You do all indexing decisions here. No other “SEO health / indexing / ready-to-index” pages.
Result: ONE SEO page for all crawl / index decisions.
C. Optional Keep – Money stuff
/admin/products
If Products are still tied to Stripe in a separate schema and you’re actually using them, keep Products as its own nav item for now.
Long term, you can convert products into CMS objects too (type=product) and control them via the Content screen – but you don’t have to solve that today.
/admin/blog + /admin/blog/edit/[id]
Ask yourself bluntly: are you actually using the rich blog editor, or are we going to move blog posts to CMS JSON like everything else?
If you barely use it → hide Blog from the nav and plan a migration later.
If you actively write in it → keep Blog as a separate nav item for now and treat it as “legacy rich editor” until you’re ready to unify.
If you want max simplicity now, I’d aim for:
Nav = Content | SEO | Products | (Blog if really needed)
3. What you can safely kill now
Given CMS Import + Content Manager:
You can trash or hide these from nav:
/admin/content-factory – old generation flow, replaced by CMS Import
/admin/articles – redundant; just filter type = article in Content
/admin/tools – redundant; filter type = tool
/admin/mbbs – redundant; again, just types + filters
/admin/clusters – redundant; cluster is a column + filter in Content
/admin/seo-health – merge its info into Content’s health column
/admin/ready-to-index – a filter inside SEO page, not its own page
/admin/indexing – duplicate of SEO Control
/admin/engines – you rarely touch this; remove it from nav, keep the route if you ever need it manually
Important: you don’t have to actually delete the routes immediately – you can just remove them from the sidebar so your brain only sees what matters.
4. Target final admin nav
Short term realistic goal:
Content (merged content-manager + cms-import)
SEO (seo-control)
Products (if you need Stripe catalog control)
Blog (only if you truly use the rich editor)
If you’re ruthless and willing to move blog/products into CMS later, your endgame nav is literally:
Content | SEO
Everything else becomes a filter, a column, or a modal inside those two.
So: ignore Replit’s “5 pages max” suggestion – that’s still too many.
Your architecture is powerful enough that you don’t need 10 views to manage it. Two core screens + 1–2 optional money/blog screens is the clean version.
