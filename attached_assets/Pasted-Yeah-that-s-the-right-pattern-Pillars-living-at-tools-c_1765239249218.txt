Yeah, that’s the right pattern. Pillars living at /tools/[cluster-slug] keeps everything consistent and “tools-first”, which is what you want.
A few sharp tweaks so you don’t miss anything:
1. Pillar route + cluster registry
If pillar pages live at /tools/[cluster-slug], then for the zip cluster:
Route:
app/tools/zip-file-tools/page.tsx
In CLUSTER_REGISTRY, make sure the pillar slug matches the actual URL:
pillarSlug: "/tools/zip-file-tools",
toolSlugs: [
  // your 7 zip tools
],
articleSlugs: [],
Then the expected-links code should just use cluster.pillarSlug directly, no manual /tools/${...} concatenation needed.
2. What the pillar page needs (minimum viable pillar)
For app/tools/zip-file-tools/page.tsx, make sure it includes:
✅ SEO meta (title, description, canonical, etc.)
✅ Hero section
“Online ZIP file tools” / “Compress, extract, and manage ZIPs in one place”
✅ Quick reference table
7 rows, one per tool, with:
Name
Short description
Link to /tools/[slug]
✅ Tool cards
Same 7 tools again, more visual, each with:
H3 title
One-line benefit
CTA button → tool URL
✅ Pro tips block
“When to compress vs resize”
“How much to compress before quality dies”
“Best practices when sending large ZIPs”
✅ FAQ section with schema
3–5 common questions:
Is it safe?
Is there a file size limit?
Do you store my files?
Is this free?
Add JSON-LD <script type="application/ld+json"> for FAQ markup
✅ CTA
“Start with [Best general tool] → button”
Or “Pick a tool below to begin”
Also: make sure the pillar links back to each tool (which you’re doing via table/cards). That’s how you get the internal link count up.
3. Expected-links API change
Right now you were thinking:
Update expected-links API to use /tools/${cluster.pillarSlug}
Better: don’t double-prefix.
If pillarSlug in the registry is already /tools/zip-file-tools, the API should just do:
const pillarUrl = cluster.pillarSlug; // already full path
Then your expected links logic is:
expectedLinks = siblingTools + Math.min(articleSlugs.length, 3) + 1; // pillar
No /pillars/ assumptions anywhere.
4. Global URLs + CMS object
Two things people always forget:
CMS object for the pillar, not just the file:
Add a cms_objects entry for zip-file-tools with:
type: "pillar" or "article" (whatever you use)
slug: "zip-file-tools"
path: "/tools/zip-file-tools"
SEO fields
Interlink metadata (parent cluster, siblings if you’re tracking)
Global URLs registry entry:
url: "/tools/zip-file-tools"
title: "Zip File Tools"
source: "cms" (if you track source)
is_indexed: false by default, then you toggle on when ready
That’s what makes it appear in the SEO panel and Ready to Index.
5. Sanity check on your plan
Your list:
Create pillar at /tools/zip-file-tools with hero, table, cards, pro tips, FAQ, CTA
Update expected-links API to use the actual route
Register in global_urls so it appears in SEO panel
Yes.
Add:
Make sure CLUSTER_REGISTRY.pillarSlug = "/tools/zip-file-tools"
Create a CMS object for the pillar, not just the route
Do that, and the zip cluster will be “proper”:
One pillar
7 tools
All interlinked
Correct expected links
Shows up clean in admin
That’s exactly how it should work.
