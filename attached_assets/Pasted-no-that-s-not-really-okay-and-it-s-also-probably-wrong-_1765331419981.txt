no, that’s not really okay and it’s also probably wrong technically.
1. Inline hex colors don’t fix the actual problem
They said:
“inline styles with hardcoded hex colors… should override any parent styling”
That’s only true for the same property (e.g. color).
Your problem is almost certainly parent opacity or filter, not the color value.
If a parent has opacity: 0.5, everything inside is rendered at 50% opacity, no matter what color you set on the child.
Same with filter: brightness() / grayscale() / etc.
So:
Hard-coding #18181b does not override a parent opacity: 0.6.
If it looks faded, the inline color is just lipstick on the pig.
They’re “fixing” the symptom and leaving the root bug in place.
2. Hard-coding hex is against what you’re trying to build
You’re trying to run a serious system with:
Tailwind utility classes
A consistent design system
Dark/light themes and future reskins
Inline hex colors:
Break theming
Increase tech debt
Make future redesigns annoying
Are completely unnecessary here
You were right: we don’t hard code stuff anymore unless it’s a last-resort quick hack — and this isn’t that.
3. What you should tell Replit instead
Something like this (you can paste/adjust):
The inline hex colors are not the solution I want here.
The issue is not the text color, it’s that the whole engine area is being visually dimmed by a parent style (likely opacity, filter: brightness, or grayscale).
Please:
Remove the inline color styles you added to the Price Engine / FAQ (go back to using our Tailwind/text classes or existing design tokens).
Find the parent wrapper(s) for tool pages and marketing layouts that apply any of:
opacity-*
filter / brightness / grayscale
backdrop-brightness-*
or pointer-events-none opacity-* on a container
Ensure the main tool content / engine container is rendered at full opacity with no filters. If we need a dimmed effect, apply it only to specific preview cards, not the whole page.
Show me the diff where you removed the dimming styles from the parent and reverted the inline hard-coded colors.
That keeps your system clean and actually fixes the bug.
4. TL;DR
Their explanation is weak and technically misleading.
Inline hex colors don’t override parent opacity.
You’re right to push back: fix the parent opacity/filter, revert the hard-coded colors, and stick to your design system.
