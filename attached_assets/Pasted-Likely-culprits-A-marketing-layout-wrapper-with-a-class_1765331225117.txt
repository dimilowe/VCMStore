Likely culprits:
A marketing/layout wrapper with a class like opacity-50, opacity-60, brightness-75, backdrop-brightness, etc.
A group state like data-dimmed="true" and a class such as group-[data-dimmed=true]:opacity-40 on the inner content.
A “disabled” / “preview” state (pointer-events-none opacity-40) that was meant for locked tools and is now wrapping everything.
You want only specific things dimmed (e.g. preview sections), not the entire engine container.
What to fix (conceptually)
Find the marketing/wrapper component that wraps PriceEngine and the other tools.
Remove any opacity / brightness / grayscale on the wrapper that affects all children.
If dimming is needed for something (e.g. “coming soon” blocks), move that dimming class down to that specific section, not the entire content wrapper.
Replit Prompt – paste this in so it hunts and fixes it
Use this exact prompt in Replit AI in your VCM Suite repo:
I have an issue where all my tools/engines (including the new Price Engine pages like /tools/track-price) are rendering faded/washed out, as if they have reduced opacity.
Search the codebase for the layout / wrapper that is used for tool pages and marketing pages around tools. It might be something like MarketingWrapper, MarketingLayout, ToolLayout, CreatorToolsLayout, or similar – whatever wraps the engine renderer.
Look for any classes or styles on that parent that would globally dim content, such as:
opacity-50, opacity-60, etc.
brightness-*, grayscale, backdrop-brightness-*
pointer-events-none opacity-40 combinations
group-[data-dimmed=true]:opacity-* or similar data-driven dimming on a container
The goal: the main tool content (the engine renderer area) should NOT be dimmed at all. Only specific sections (e.g. “Pro only preview”, locked sections, etc.) may be dimmed.
Refactor the layout so that:
The root wrapper for tools uses full opacity: e.g. remove any opacity-* classes from the main content container.
If there is a “dimmed” or “preview” state, apply that class only to the specific element that should appear faded (for example, a card that says “Coming soon” or a screenshot mockup), not the entire page or engine container.
Specifically verify the page at /tools/track-price:
The form, inputs, and the “Check Price” button should render at full opacity and look like normal interactive elements.
Only intentionally locked/pro-only areas (if any) should appear dimmed.
After changes, run the app and confirm that:
/tools/track-price and /tools/track-prices-on-amazon look normal (not faded).
Other tool pages still look correct, and any dimming behavior is now scoped and not global.
Show me the diff of what you changed, especially in the layout/wrapper component and any global styles you touched.
Once that’s done, reload the page:
If the input fields and button look normal, but only the upgrade area is dimmed → that’s correct.
If the whole viewport is still pale, there’s probably another wrapper higher up (global Layout, MarketingShell, etc.) using opacity/brightness – run the same process on that.
You’re not crazy; this is just one rogue class on a parent nuking all the children.
