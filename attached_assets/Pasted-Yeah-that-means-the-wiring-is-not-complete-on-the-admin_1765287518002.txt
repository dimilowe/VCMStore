Yeah, that means the wiring is not complete on the admin list view.
The feature is in the codebase somewhere, but the table you’re looking at is still the old version.
There are only three places this can be broken:
The tools list query isn’t returning cloud_tags
The admin tools API isn’t including cloud_tags
The table component never renders a “Clouds” column
Here’s exactly what you / Replit need to check.
1. Make sure the tools list query returns cloud_tags
Wherever the admin tools list is loaded (something like lib/cms/getCmsTools.ts or /api/admin/tools):
const result = await query<{
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  engine: string | null;
  cluster_slug: string | null;
  // ...
  cloud_tags: string[] | null;
}>(`
  SELECT
    slug,
    data->>'title' AS title,
    data->>'engine' AS engine,
    cluster_slug,
    COALESCE(cloud_tags, '{}') AS cloud_tags
  FROM cms_objects
  WHERE type = 'tool'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
`);
And in the mapper:
const tools: AdminToolRow[] = result.rows.map((row) => ({
  slug: row.slug,
  title: row.title,
  engine: row.engine,
  cluster_slug: row.cluster_slug,
  cloud_tags: (row.cloud_tags ?? []) as CloudSlug[],
  // ...
}));
If cloud_tags isn’t in this query, the UI cannot show it.
2. Add the “Clouds” column to app/admin/tools/page.tsx
Right now your table header is basically:
<thead>
  <tr>
    {/* checkbox */}
    <th>Tool</th>
    <th>Engine</th>
    <th>Cluster</th>
    <th>Links</th>
    <th>Indexed</th>
    <th>Actions</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
You need to add Clouds between Cluster and Links:
<th>Clouds</th>
And in the row rendering, add a cell that uses tool.cloud_tags:
<tbody>
  {tools.map((tool) => (
    <tr key={tool.slug}>
      {/* existing cells... */}
      <td>
        <button
          type="button"
          className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-full border px-2 py-0.5 text-xs"
          onClick={() => openCloudTagsModal(tool.slug, tool.cloud_tags ?? [])}
        >
          {tool.cloud_tags?.length ?? 0}
        </button>
      </td>
      <td>{/* Links */}</td>
      <td>{/* Indexed */}</td>
      <td>{/* Actions */}</td>
    </tr>
  ))}
</tbody>
Hook openCloudTagsModal up to whatever modal component you already built for editing tags on a single tool.
If you never actually created that function/modal on this page, that’s why Replit “thinks” it exists but you don’t see it. In that case, simplest is:
Reuse the existing CloudTagsEditor component you already wired on the single-tool admin page.
Local state: selectedTool + isCloudModalOpen.
Inside the modal, render <CloudTagsEditor /> and save via the same admin API.
3. Quick sanity checks
After those changes:
Run in DB:
SELECT slug, cloud_tags FROM cms_objects WHERE type = 'tool' LIMIT 5;
Make sure some rows actually have tags (not just {}).
In the browser:
Reload /admin/tools
Confirm the header shows Clouds
Confirm each row shows a number
Click → modal opens → tags show → saving updates DB
Bottom line: your Cloud dashboards + upsells are wired, but this admin list column was never actually added to the table + query, which is why you don’t see it. Fix those two spots and the column will show.
