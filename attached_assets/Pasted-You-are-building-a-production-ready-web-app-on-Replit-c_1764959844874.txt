You are building a production-ready web app on Replit called:

   "Maker Quotes Generator – Inspiring Quotes for Creators & Builders"

This is a micro-tool for creators, makers, and entrepreneurs who want instant quotes for social posts, thumbnails, blogs, and bios.

====================================
TECH STACK
====================================

- Node.js + Express backend (static file server only)
- Vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript frontend (no React)
- No external AI or quote APIs – generate quotes locally using templates and a curated quote bank.
- All logic in the browser; backend only serves static files.

====================================
PROJECT STRUCTURE
====================================

Create:

- package.json
- index.js                 (Express server)
- public/
    - index.html           (UI)
    - styles.css           (styling)
    - app.js               (quote logic + DOM)

====================================
SERVER (index.js)
====================================

Requirements:

- Use Express.
- Serve static files from the "public" directory.
- Listen on process.env.PORT || 3000.
- No API routes necessary; all quote generation is in app.js.

Pseudocode:

- const express = require("express")
- const app = express()
- app.use(express.static("public"))
- app.listen(PORT, …)

====================================
FRONTEND UI (public/index.html)
====================================

Build a single-page layout with:

<title>Maker Quotes Generator – Free Quotes for Creators</title>

Main content:

1. Header section:
   - H1: "Maker Quotes Generator"
   - Short paragraph: e.g. "Generate inspiring quotes for makers, creators, and builders. Perfect for social posts, thumbnails, and captions."

2. Controls section (a form-like area):
   - A dropdown/select for **Theme** with options:
     - Creativity
     - Persistence
     - Innovation
     - Entrepreneurship
     - Failure & Learning
   - A dropdown/select for **Tone**:
     - Motivational
     - Serious
     - Funny
     - Short & punchy
   - A dropdown/select for **Format**:
     - Quote only
     - Quote + Author
     - Social caption
   - A number input: "How many quotes?" (1–20; default 10)
   - A primary button: "Generate Quotes"

3. Results section:
   - A container that will display a list/grid of quotes.
   - Each quote card should include:
     - The quote text
     - Optional author line (if present)
     - Buttons:
       - "Copy text"
       - Optional "Copy as caption" (same text but with quotes removed / formatted)
   - If no results yet, show a friendly placeholder like "Choose options and generate your first maker quotes."

4. Static SEO section below the tool:
   - H2: "What Are Maker Quotes?"
   - Short explanation about makers, creators, entrepreneurs.
   - H2: "How to Use Maker Quotes in Your Content"
     - Bullet list: thumbnails, Instagram captions, TikTok hooks, YouTube community posts, posters, etc.
   - H2: "Examples of Famous Maker & Creator Quotes"
     - Static list of 15–20 famous quotes (from well-known public figures, no copyrighted song lyrics or long passages).

Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).

====================================
STYLING (public/styles.css)
====================================

Goal: clean, modern, creator-friendly.

- Body:
  - background: #f5f5f5
  - font-family: system fonts
- Main container:
  - max-width: 960px
  - margin: 40px auto
  - padding: 24px
  - background: white
  - border-radius: 12px
  - box-shadow: subtle
- Controls:
  - Use CSS grid or flexbox.
  - On desktop: 2 columns; on mobile: 1 column.
  - Labels above inputs.
- Buttons:
  - primary color (e.g. #111827 or #2563EB)
  - border-radius: 6px
  - hover state.
- Quote cards:
  - background: #f9fafb
  - padding: 16px
  - border-radius: 8px
  - margin-bottom: 12px
  - display flex / column with space between quote and buttons.
- Use a responsive grid for quotes on wider screens (e.g. 2 columns).

====================================
QUOTE LOGIC (public/app.js)
====================================

Implement all logic in plain JavaScript.

1. On DOMContentLoaded:
   - Get references to:
     - Theme select
     - Tone select
     - Format select
     - Count input
     - Generate button
     - Results container
     - Optional status/error text area.

2. Create a **base quote library**:

   - Define an array of objects like:

     ```js
     const BASE_QUOTES = [
       {
         text: "Makers aren’t waiting for permission; they’re busy building the future.",
         tags: ["creativity", "entrepreneurship", "innovation"],
         tone: ["motivational"]
       },
       {
         text: "Every failed prototype is data, not defeat.",
         tags: ["failure", "learning", "innovation"],
         tone: ["serious", "motivational"]
       },
       // add 40–60 maker/creator/entrepreneur style quotes
     ];
     ```

   - Focus on **original**, generic maker/creator style lines to avoid copyright issues; do not copy famous long passages verbatim.
   - Also add a small list of **author-attributed quotes** that are well-known but short (e.g. classic inventor/entrepreneur quotes), staying within fair use and avoiding long copyrighted passages.

3. Create a **quote generation function**:

   - `function generateQuotes({ theme, tone, format, count })`
   - Filter BASE_QUOTES by:
     - theme (tag match)
     - tone (tone match)
     - If filter yields too few, fall back to broader selection.
   - Randomly select `count` quotes from the filtered list (without strict uniqueness if not enough options).
   - For each selected quote object, transform based on `format`:
     - `Quote only`: just `text`.
     - `Quote + author`: if `quote.author` exists, format as `"text" – Author`. If no author, treat as quote only.
     - `Social caption`: may add a short prefix or suffix, e.g. `text + " #maker #creator"`.
   - Return an array of strings or objects with `{ displayText, rawQuote, author }`.

4. Rendering:

   - `renderQuotes(quotesArray)`:
     - Clear previous results.
     - For each quote, create a DOM element:
       - <article class="quote-card">
         - <p class="quote-text">…</p>
         - optional <p class="quote-author">…</p>
         - <div class="quote-actions">
             - <button>Copy</button>
           </div>
       - Add event listener on "Copy" to use `navigator.clipboard.writeText(...)` with the quote text.
     - Append to results container.
     - If no quotes (e.g. error), show a message.

5. Event flow:

   - On "Generate Quotes" click:
     - Prevent default if using a form.
     - Read theme, tone, format, count.
     - Do basic validation (count between 1 and 20; show error if invalid).
     - Call `generateQuotes()` and then `renderQuotes()`.

6. Optional polish:

   - Show a tiny “Generating…” status while running (even though it’s instant).
   - Smooth scroll to the results section after generating.
   - If user changes controls and clicks again, simply overwrite previous results.

====================================
STATIC QUOTE SECTION (SEO)
====================================

In index.html, under the tool, create a section:

- H2: "Famous Maker & Creator Quotes"
- Paragraph introduction about makers and creativity.
- An unordered list of ~15 short, non-lyric, non-long copyrighted quotes from public figures (inventors, founders, designers, creators). Keep any direct quotes under ~20–25 words.

Example style (paraphrase where helpful to avoid long verbatim copying):

- "The best way to predict the future is to invent it. – Alan Kay"
- "Done is better than perfect. – Sheryl Sandberg"
- etc.

====================================
FOOTER
====================================

Add a small footer with muted text:

- "Generated quotes are for inspiration only. Always make sure your content reflects your own voice."
- A small tagline like: "Tool by a creator for creators."

====================================
QUALITY CHECKS
====================================

- App runs with `npm install` and `npm start`.
- All functionality is purely client-side; no external API calls.
- Copy buttons work in modern browsers.
- Layout is responsive and looks good on mobile.
- Code is clean, commented, and easy to extend (e.g., adding more themes later).

Build the complete project with all of the above.
