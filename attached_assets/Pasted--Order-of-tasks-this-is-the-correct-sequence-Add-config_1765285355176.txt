✅ Order of tasks (this is the correct sequence)
Add configuration type for dashboard
Define CloudDashboardEngineConfig in lib/types/cms.ts.
Add "CloudDashboardEngine" to your EngineName union.
Plug it into your EngineConfig union.
Make sure CMSObject.engine can be "CloudDashboardEngine" and engine_config typed accordingly.
Create dashboard engine component
components/engines/CloudDashboardEngine.tsx with:
hero block
featuredProducts row
appRow chips
shortcuts grid
recent files placeholder
Register dashboard engine for use
In your main renderer switch (e.g. CmsRenderer), add:
case "CloudDashboardEngine":
  return <CloudDashboardEngine cms={cms as any} />;
At this point, any CMS object with engine: "CloudDashboardEngine" won’t crash.
Create page for cloud details (route)
Either:
Use your existing CMS page route (if it already handles arbitrary slugs via cms_objects), or
Add /clouds/[slug] page that:
Loads CMS object by slug (creation-cloud, video-cloud, etc.)
Passes it into CmsRenderer.
Keep routing dumb: it should just fetch CMS + render engine.
Add way to get cloud data
You already have the CLOUDS registry; keep using that.
For dashboards, you don’t strictly need extra “cloud data” beyond:
CMS object (for title/description/engine_config)
Optionally: query tools with cloud_tags @> ARRAY['creation'] if you want appRow to be dynamic later.
For now, keep appRow manual in engine_config and treat “auto-pulling from cloud_tags” as v2.
Add initial Creation Cloud CMS object
Import the creation-cloud JSON we sketched:
type: "cloud_dashboard"
engine: "CloudDashboardEngine"
engine_config with hero, featuredProducts, appRow, shortcuts, showRecentFiles.
Confirm it appears in URL Registry as /clouds/creation-cloud.
Set isIndexed = false until you’re happy with it.
Update upsell block links
In your CloudUpsellBlock, change from:
href={`/clouds/${cloud.slug}`}
to:
href={`/clouds/${cloud.slug}-cloud`}
or whatever slug you actually used (creation-cloud, video-cloud, etc.).
This is where the Cloud upsell becomes a proper funnel:
Tool → Cloud dashboard → Product page.
Check dashboard displays correctly
Manually hit /clouds/creation-cloud:
Hero renders
Featured cards render
App row chips work (link to tools)
Shortcuts links work (tools + optional ?preset= query)
Recent files placeholder shows (or is hidden if false)
Then hit an existing tool with cloud_tags including "creation" and confirm:
Upsell appears
Clicking Creation Cloud → goes to the new dashboard page.
One small correction / decision point
You wrote:
“the appRow shows tools tagged with that cloud”
Right now, based on what you’ve implemented, appRow is manual config in engine_config. That’s fine and honestly better for v1 (you choose the “hero” tools per cloud).
Later, if you want:
You can replace appRow content by querying tools where cloud_tags contains that cloud and show top N.
Or mix: manual appRow for “featured apps” + a secondary section “More tools in this cloud” pulled from cloud_tags.
For now, don’t overcomplicate it. Manual appRow in CMS is good enough.
So yes: your approach is good.
Do it in that order, and you’ll have:
Real cloud dashboards
Clean Adobe-style entry points
Tool → Cloud → Product funnels actually working end-to-end.
