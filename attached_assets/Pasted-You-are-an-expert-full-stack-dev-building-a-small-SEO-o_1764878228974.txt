You are an expert full-stack dev building a small, SEO-optimized micro-site around the keyword “calorie counter maintenance”.

Goal:
Build a **Maintenance Calorie Calculator** (TDEE calculator) mini-site with:
- A maintenance calorie calculator on the homepage.
- Long-form SEO content about maintenance calories.
- 2 supporting articles for topical depth.
- Implemented as a Node/Express app serving static files so it runs easily on Replit.

Tech stack:
- Node.js + Express
- Static frontend in `public/` (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS)
- No React or bundlers.

Project structure:
- `index.js` → Express server
- `public/`
  - `index.html` → main maintenance calories page
  - `article-what-are-maintenance-calories.html`
  - `article-maintenance-vs-deficit-vs-surplus.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `app.js`

Server requirements:
- Serve `public` as static.
- `/` → `index.html`
- `/what-are-maintenance-calories` → `article-what-are-maintenance-calories.html`
- `/maintenance-vs-deficit-vs-surplus` → `article-maintenance-vs-deficit-vs-surplus.html`
- Listen on `process.env.PORT || 3000`.
- Add a short comment at top of `index.js` explaining install/run steps.

### Core Feature: Maintenance Calorie / TDEE Calculator

Place prominently at the top of `index.html`, under the main H1.

Inputs:
- Sex (radio: Male / Female)
- Age (years)
- Height (cm, with optional toggle for feet/inches that converts to cm)
- Weight (kg, with toggle for lb → internal kg)
- Activity level dropdown with options:
  - Sedentary (little/no exercise)
  - Lightly active (1–3 days/week)
  - Moderately active (3–5 days/week)
  - Very active (6–7 days/week)
  - Super active (hard training / physical job)

Form behavior:
- All fields required except unit toggles.
- Validate:
  - Age 14–80
  - Height 130–220 cm
  - Weight 40–200 kg
- Show inline error messages for invalid or missing values.

Logic (in `app.js`):
- Use Mifflin-St Jeor formula for BMR:

  For men:
  - `BMR = 10 × weight_kg + 6.25 × height_cm – 5 × age + 5`

  For women:
  - `BMR = 10 × weight_kg + 6.25 × height_cm – 5 × age – 161`

- Apply activity multipliers:
  - Sedentary: 1.2
  - Lightly active: 1.375
  - Moderately active: 1.55
  - Very active: 1.725
  - Super active: 1.9

- Compute:
  - BMR (rounded)
  - Maintenance calories (TDEE) = BMR × activity multiplier
  - Suggested:
    - Mild deficit (~–10 to –15%)
    - Aggressive deficit (~–20%)
    - Mild surplus (+10%)
    - Bulking surplus (+15–20%)

Output card:
- Show:
  - “Your BMR: XXXX kcal/day”
  - “Maintenance calories: XXXX kcal/day”
  - “Suggested for fat loss: XXXX–YYYY kcal/day”
  - “Suggested for muscle gain: XXXX–YYYY kcal/day”
- Add disclaimer: “Estimates only. Not medical or nutrition advice.”

UX:
- On calculate:
  - If form valid → show results card and scroll to it.
  - If invalid → scroll to first invalid field and highlight it.
- Add a small “Recalculate” or “Reset” link.

Design:
- Same style as the walking site: centered container, max width ~900–1000px, responsive, modern, clean.

### SEO Requirements – index.html (Main Page)

Target keyword: **“calorie counter maintenance”** and variants like “maintenance calorie calculator”, “TDEE calculator”, “how many calories to maintain weight”.

Head:
- `<title>` should include: “Calorie Counter Maintenance – Maintenance Calorie (TDEE) Calculator”.
- Meta description describing maintenance calories and the calculator.

Body structure:

- H1: “Calorie Counter Maintenance – Find Your Daily Maintenance Calories”
- Short intro paragraph (2–3 sentences) using the phrase “calorie counter maintenance” once.

Below the calculator, add detailed educational content:

1. **H2: What Are Maintenance Calories?**
   - Explain what maintenance calories are and why they matter.

2. **H2: How This Maintenance Calorie Calculator Works**
   - Explain BMR + activity multiplier.
   - Briefly mention Mifflin-St Jeor.

3. **H2: Maintenance Calories by Activity Level**
   - Add a table:
     - Rows: example weights (60kg, 70kg, 80kg).
     - Columns: sedentary, light, moderate, very active.
     - Use a sample age and height for consistency.

4. **H2: Maintenance vs Deficit vs Surplus**
   - Explain how many calories to cut for fat loss and how many to add for muscle gain.

5. **H2: How Often Should You Recalculate Your Maintenance Calories?**
   - e.g. when weight changes, activity changes, etc.

6. **H2: FAQ – Maintenance Calories and TDEE**
   Include at least 5 Q&A entries, like:
   - “Is this maintenance calorie estimate accurate?”
   - “Can I lose weight eating my maintenance calories?”
   - “How much of a deficit is safe?”
   - “Do I need to count calories forever?”
   - “What if my actual weight change doesn’t match the calculator?”

Write everything as real, human-sounding fitness content, no lorem ipsum.

### Conversion / CTA Modules

On **index.html**:

1. **Recommended Tools Card**
   - Title: “More Free Health & Fitness Tools”
   - List 3 placeholder links:
     - “Calorie Counter Walking”
     - “Calorie Counter Steps”
     - “Macro Calculator”
   - Use `href="#"` and TODO comments to replace later with real URLs.

2. **Post-Result CTA**
   - Under results card:
     - Heading: “Turn Your Maintenance Calories Into a Real Plan”
     - Short explanation.
     - Button: “Get My Free Meal Planning Template”
       - `href="#"` + TODO comment.

3. **Persistent Bottom Bar (same pattern as walking site)**
   - Small fixed bar on all pages:
     - Text: “Want more free tools like this?”
     - Button: “Explore All Tools”
     - Close (X) icon.
   - JS + localStorage handling so once closed, it stays closed.

Style the bar in `styles.css` and implement logic in `app.js`.

### Code Quality

- Semantic HTML.
- Clean CSS with reusable classes.
- JS commented around formulas and key logic.
- No external JS libraries.
- `npm start` should start the Express server and serve the site.
