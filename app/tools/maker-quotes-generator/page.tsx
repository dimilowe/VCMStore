              What Are Maker Quotes?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              <strong>Maker quotes</strong> are inspiring phrases crafted specifically for creators, builders, entrepreneurs, and anyone who makes things. Unlike generic motivational quotes, maker quotes speak directly to the challenges of building products, launching businesses, and creating art. They celebrate the messy reality of making—the failures, pivots, late nights, and breakthrough moments.
