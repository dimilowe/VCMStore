              How the AI YouTube Thumbnail Analyzer Works

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How the AI Scores Clarity</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Clarity measures whether your thumbnail&apos;s main subject or message is instantly recognizable. Our AI vision model evaluates 
                  if a viewer can understand what your video is about within 1 second—the typical time someone spends glancing at a thumbnail 
                  in their feed. High clarity scores mean your subject stands out clearly against the background with no visual confusion.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How Mobile Readability Is Tested</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Over 70% of YouTube views happen on mobile devices, where thumbnails appear as small as 120 x 68 pixels. Our analyzer 
                  evaluates whether your text remains readable at these tiny sizes, checking font size, contrast against the background, 
                  and overall legibility. If your text can&apos;t be read on mobile, your CTR will suffer significantly.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How Composition Is Evaluated</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Composition analysis examines the visual hierarchy and balance of your thumbnail. The AI checks if elements are 
                  positioned effectively, if there&apos;s visual breathing room, and if the layout guides the eye toward the most important 
                  elements. Cluttered thumbnails with competing elements score lower; clean, focused compositions score higher.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Humans are wired to respond to emotion. Thumbnails with expressive faces, dynamic energy, or emotional cues consistently 
                  outperform bland alternatives. The intrigue score measures whether your thumbnail creates a &quot;curiosity gap&quot;—making 
                  viewers want to click to satisfy their curiosity. Together, emotion and intrigue are often the difference between 
                  a 2% CTR and a 10% CTR.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  YouTube displays thumbnails against a white background. Thumbnails with strong color contrast—bright colors, bold 
                  outlines, or dramatic lighting—pop off the page and grab attention. Our analyzer measures the visual separation 
                  between elements and evaluates whether your thumbnail will stand out in a crowded feed full of competing content.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How YouTube Chooses Which Thumbnails to Show</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  YouTube&apos;s algorithm tracks how often viewers click on your thumbnail (CTR) and whether they watch the video after 
                  clicking (watch time). High CTR signals that your thumbnail is compelling, leading YouTube to show it to more viewers. 
                  This creates a virtuous cycle: better thumbnails → more clicks → more impressions → more views. Optimizing your 
                  thumbnail is one of the highest-ROI activities for growing your channel.

              Why Thumbnails Matter for YouTube CTR
            </h2>
            <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 space-y-4">
              <p>
                Your YouTube thumbnail is the single most important factor in whether someone clicks on your video. While titles matter, 
                the human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text. In the split second a viewer scrolls past your video, 
                your thumbnail must capture attention, communicate value, and compel action.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>The CTR-Algorithm Connection:</strong> YouTube&apos;s recommendation system heavily weighs click-through rate when deciding 
                which videos to promote. A video with 8% CTR will receive dramatically more impressions than one with 4% CTR—even if 
                both have the same watch time. This means small thumbnail improvements can have exponential effects on your total views.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Top YouTubers routinely report that changing a thumbnail can double or triple a video&apos;s 
                performance. MrBeast famously A/B tests dozens of thumbnails per video. The difference between a good thumbnail and 
                a great one isn&apos;t incremental—it can mean the difference between 10,000 views and 1,000,000 views.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Thumbnail Best Practices:</strong> High-performing thumbnails share common traits: they use 2-3 bold colors maximum, 
                feature expressive human faces when possible, include minimal text (3-5 words max), create curiosity or emotional 
                response, and remain clear at mobile sizes. Avoid cluttered designs, small text, low contrast, and generic stock imagery.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>The Testing Imperative:</strong> You should never publish a video with an untested thumbnail. Use our free AI analyzer 
                to check your thumbnail before uploading, iterate based on the feedback, and give your video the best possible chance 
                of success. A few minutes of optimization can mean thousands of additional views.
